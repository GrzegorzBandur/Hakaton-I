The bottom line is: Just about anything that is on this site, on the web, on TV, on CD\'s, on DVD\'s, in books & in magazines is probably copyrighted by someone. Copyright can be a confusing territory for many people. In many cases the natural confusion over the sometimes varied circumstances surrounding copyright will lead people to rely on rumor or myth more often than the actual law which naturally confuses the matter even more. In this document we will attempt to eliminate some of the confusion and counter many of the myths surrounding copyright and to present clearly the deviantART policies and practices with regard to copyright. The availability of this document should not be construed as rendering legal or other professional advice, and this document is not a substitute for the advice of an attorney. If you require legal advice, you should seek the services of a qualified attorney. How do I get Copyright? Under most national laws and international copyright treaties you receive a copyright automatically in any original work as you make it. Registration may be required to exercise some rights, like commencing a lawsuit. Copyright does NOT protect ideas. Copyright protects the expression of ideas or the ways in which an idea is materially placed or expressed in the work. What is Copyright Infringement? To simplify this question, copyright infringement occurs when you do certain things with a creative work which someone else produced without first getting the proper permission. Some examples of copyright infringement (this is only a partial listing) can include: Placing someone else\'s photograph or creative work online without proper permission. Using a creative work commercially without permission. Adapting someone else\'s creative work found in one medium to another medium, such as making a book into a movie or a photograph into a painting. Modifying or editing a creative work without proper permission. How Can I Avoid Infringing on Someone\'s Copyright? The best way to avoid infringing on the rights of another creative person is to use your skill, talent and imagination to create your own completely original work. When we use the word \'original\' we don\'t mean that you must come up with an idea which hasn\'t been used before - recall that copyright does not protect ideas. When used in reference to copyright "original" means that you created your work without referencing or deliberately copying anyone else\'s work during the process. Ensure that all parts of your work, both visual and audio, are your own original creations. If you have used materials which are owned by other people or companies make certain that you have obtained proper permission or licensing for the use before you place your work online. You can also obtain permission to use a copyrighted work by license. You can read more here and here . What Sort of Things are Copyrighted? The easy answer to this question is that just about any creative work that is less than 150 years old you might find should be considered copyrighted by default. A work is not required to have a copyright statement printed on it or near it in order to be considered copyrighted so do not assume that the work is unprotected simply because you cannot see a notice written anywhere. Also do not confuse the fact that a work is publicly available with the idea that it is in the public domain or free for use. Being easy to find on the internet does not affect a work\'s copyrighted status. There are many exceptions to the 150 year guideline, but you are best advised to obtain legal advice from an expert if you intend to rely on the possibility that a modern work is not copyrighted. Some Cautions In most cases it does not matter how much of the material you have used, whether it\'s a single frame, a few moments of audio, a short clip of video or any other sampling it\'s still considered to be protected by copyright and you still require the owner\'s permission for use. It doesn\'t matter how you obtained the material, it\'s still considered copyrighted and you still need permission. It doesn\'t matter whether or not you\'ve credited the proper owner, it\'s still considered copyrighted and you still need permission. It doesn\'t matter if you are not selling it or making a profit, it\'s still considered copyrighted and you still need permission. It doesn\'t matter if you can find other people using things without permission, it\'s still considered copyrighted and you still need permission. It doesn\'t matter if you\'ve edited it a little bit or made a few alterations, if it\'s recognizable it\'s still considered copyrighted and you still need permission. Read licenses carefully to understand the type of permission they provide. For example, there are many versions of the Creative Commons - each giving different permissions. What Happens When You Submit Infringing Works to deviantART? Any copyright owner following the procedures in this Copyright Policy can require deviantART to remove his or her copyrighted content in use by a member of deviantART. When through the proper notice we become aware that a submission to deviantART infringes upon the copyrights of another artist, creative person or company, we will immediately delete it. This is a legal requirement which we fulfill immediately; you will not receive an advanced warning and you will not be given an opportunity to \'fix it\'. If you believe that a submission on deviantART infringes on your copyright you may either report the submission using our internal reporting system or send us a copyright notice via mail or email. A member of staff will review your notice and act accordingly. If you believe that one of your submissions was removed in error you may contact our helpdesk or otherwise file a counter notice. If you are found to repeatedly post infringing content, your account will be suspended and serious offenders will have their account banned and deactivated. We consider three strikes as an indication of being a repeat infringer subject to ban. If you are found deliberately misrepresenting the copyrighted work of another as your own your account will be immediately banned and deactivated. The copyright owner may also decide to sue you directly if you infringe his or her copyright in posting content to deviantART. What about "Fair Use" "Fair Use" is the notion that some public and private uses of copyrighted works should not require the permission of a copyright owner. These circumstances are very limited, complex to analyze under the law and require the help of expert advice from a lawyer. We recommend you talk to your own lawyer if you want to know more about fair use as it applies to the work you are doing. If it turns out that it isn\'t fair use, you may be liable for very serious money damages. To learn more about fair use you can go here , here , here , and here . If you take my work down am I protected from a lawsuit? No. Even if deviantART takes an infringing work down, you may still be responsible for very significant damages if the copyright owner decides to sue you. Notification of Copyright Infringement Instructions for Copyright Owners This section contains the formal requirements of the Copyright Act with respect to the rights of copyright owners whose content appears on deviantART without authorization and instruction to copyright owners. To file a copyright infringement notification with deviantART (also commonly known as a "DMCA takedown notice"), the copyright owner or an authorized agent acting on his or her behalf will need to send a written communication that includes substantially the following: 1. A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. 2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site. 3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material. In this regard please provide URLs when you identify the location of the material. 4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted. 5. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. 6.

Deviant Login Buy Art Buy T-Shirts & Gear Buy adCast Buy Premium Upgrade Shop \xc2\xa0 Join deviantART for FREE Take the Tour Etiquette Policy Introduction deviantART is an expansive, worldwide community of artists of every age, and every nationality who create works spanning every medium, every subject and every level of talent and skill. As the guiding force of this large and vibrant community we have two primary and often conflicting goals in the service we provide for you, the members of the community; the first being to ensure that members are free to express themselves within reason with as few restrictions as possible while nurturing an environment of creativity, learning, and talent and the second is to protect the members of the community, to the best of our abilities, from infringement of copyright, discrimination, harassment, and prejudice. All members of the deviantART community are expected to be familiar with these rules of etiquette and they will be enforced evenly and without bias in every situation which is brought to the attention of the administration regardless of the membership status of the user in question. Guidelines for Deviants; Quality and Placement It is our policy to welcome artists of all levels from amateur to professional and to that end we do not attach any minimum standards of quality to deviations submitted by our membership; all manner of artworks are welcome providing they meet with our etiquette and copyright policies. While we do not impose quality standards we do ask that you practice self-moderation in what you choose to submit and that you submit your works into the most appropriate gallery. While we encourage the submission of only your very best works we have provided an area for those submissions which may fall short of that \'top quality\' mark; this is your "Scrapbook" gallery and we highly encourage its use. Our community volunteers may elect to move one or more of your deviations from the Gallery categories into a different, more appropriate, section or into the Scrapbook category; we ask that you accept this decision gracefully and with a mature attitude. If you desire a full explanation for this action, or if you feel the administrative action was performed in error, you should submit an inquiry to the official deviantART Helpdesk and include a link to the relevant deviation. Please do not bring these issues into the Forums, userpages, or other areas of deviantART. Prohibited Commentary Prohibited commentary is typically considered to be inherently disrespectful, aggressive, or otherwise abusive. We must insist that you refrain from comments which are racist, bigoted, or which otherwise offensively target a philosophy or religion. In addition we ask that our members avoid making offensive remarks based on gender or sexual preference and that you do not make any remark, comment or critique which is intended to be a direct insult to an individual, group, or genre of artwork. Hate propaganda is met with zero tolerance. Comments which are overly aggressive, personally insulting or needlessly abusive are also prohibited. If you feel that you have been the target of harassment, personal insults or other severe behavior please notify the staff by using the official deviantART helpdesk. Please be aware that the staff will only directly intervene in cases which are considered severe; minor situations may be dealt with using tools made available to all registered members. Discouraged Commentary Discouraged commentary is typically considered to have the potential to escalate into an aggressive or abusive situation. While not strictly prohibited we must insist that all personal arguments, disagreements, and other volatile "personal" issues within be confined to private communications such as Notes, emails, or Instant Messaging programs. Likewise we discourage public accusations and other similar situations; please bring all issues of this nature to the attention of the staff by notifying the official deviantART helpdesk. Exploitive Commentary Exploitive commentary is typically considered to be disruptive due to unusual or unique factors. Do not \'spam\' (send large numbers of identical notes or comments). Spamming is obnoxious and is typically used for self-promotion, or other unwanted advertising. Do not \'flood\' (place large numbers of comments rapidly on a single page or craft a single comment which consumes a large amount of page space) the forums, notes system, userpages or other areas of the site. Flooding usually disrupts page loading times and serves no useful purpose. Respect Your Fellow Artists As a vibrant and growing art community deviantART welcomes all kinds of original artworks; but we MUST insist that the artwork which you submit be your own original works. Your deviations must be your own original creations and you may only use resources which are considered legitimate and legal. Submissions which make use of works without proper permission or licensing by the original author will be removed as they come to the attention of the staff. This policy applies to all Deviation submissions, Scrapbook entries, and the preview images used for written submissions. If you have reason to believe that a deviantART submission violates this policy you should use the official Report Violation link which is available on every submission page. Mature Content When we discuss mature content we are specifically referring to deviations which contain images, subject matter, or other themes which some viewers may find offensive, distasteful, or otherwise undesirable to view or to read. The most common \'undesired\' viewing material may include, but is not limited to, images containing artistic nudity (see details below), large amounts of simulated blood and gore, or generally violent themes. DeviantART strictly prohibits the submission of materials classified as pornographic or obscene. There is no exception to this prohibition. Certain content may be deemed obscene by the administration and as such the staff reserves the right to remove such content immediately upon discovery. The administration reserves the sole right to review and classify questionable material as obscene or not obscene. Model release forms The deviantART administrative staff reserves the right to demand a Model Release form be provided for any photography (nude or otherwise) located within either your Gallery or Scrapbook areas. In the event that you receive such a request an appropriate link will be included in the notification you received. Failure to properly respond to a Model Release form demand within seven (7) days will result in the automatic removal of the associated photograph. For your own protection it is highly recommended that you have any model who poses for you sign a release form giving you the explicit permission to publish, share, distribute, and otherwise display the associated images. It is highly recommended that you provide this form immediately after submitting your photograph, especially if your subject is depicted nude. Details of this process may be found in the official deviantART FAQ. Underage models We cannot allow any nude works featuring individuals under the age of 18, nor may the works depict these individuals in a \'sexually driven\' manner such as posing in lingerie or displaying a sexually suggestive or provocative pose. This prohibition is for legal reasons; the laws in the United States are the governing laws in regards to all submissions regardless of the deviant\'s country of origin. Photographs which are suspected of depicting a minor in this manner will be temporarily suspended from public view and proper legal documentation (as outlined above) will be demanded while photographs which clearly depict a minor (including toddlers, preteens, and teenagers) in this manner will be removed without notice. Submissions of a non- photographic nature which clearly depict a minor, fictional character or otherwise, either nude or in a sexually driven manner will be removed and deleted without notice as they come to the attention of the staff. Forum Posting In addition to the outlines in the above section entitled Prohibited Commentary and Exploitive Commentary we have a few additional policies regarding comments and posts within the Forum areas of deviantART; All threads started within a specific forum and all comments within those threads should be relevant to the forums Title. This means that, for example, all threads within the Movies forum must relate to a motion picture and the comments within those threads should also remain on the appropriate topic. We encourage interactivity and we allow comments to be either positive or negative in nature providing that they remain constructive and promote a worthwhile dialogue. We insist that forum threads adhere to the same standard set forth for deviation, scrapbook, and writing submissions in terms of what is considered acceptable subject matter (i.e. no racist threads, no sexual discussions, etc). It is important to remember to be as clear in your intent as possible while communicating on the internet. Text communications do not afford a clear representation of sarcasm. Please use common sense when posting to avoid confusion. Threads which are misplaced, which contain inappropriate subject matter (such as sexual discussions), or which contain an undesirable number of insults or other violations of this etiquette policy will be locked and closed to further commentary. Avatars This section applies only to avatars which you personally use for your account; avatars submitted into a deviantART Gallery or to your Scrapbook must still conform to all official policies without exception but are not subjected to the restrictions below. Avatars used to represent your account on site are granted more leniency than standard site submissions. You may freely use material and resources with only the restrictions outlined as follows; Your avatar should not contain nudity of any sort. You may not use avatars specifically created by other users without their explicit permission. If your avatar contains a portion of a work made by another artist it will be removed by staff at the request of the original artist. In all other respects your avatar must conform to the guidelines set above in regards to hate propaganda. Exploits, Vulnerabilities, and Site Abuse The deviantART staff will not tolerate attempts to exploit or disrupt the layout, navigability, or general use of the site. Such actions disrupt the ability of the community to access and review artwork and are considered Site Abuse. We will issue no warnings for violations of this nature. Violators will be banned immediately upon the discovery of the disruption or abuse. deviantPOINTS may not be used to circumvent or interfere with the operations of deviantART and cannot be used as payment for automated services affecting a member\'s statistical or performance based metrics on deviantART. Groups All of the rules and guidelines of this Etiquette Policy apply to activities within a Group or in the management and administration of a Group. All of the policies with respect to content and commentary apply within Groups and any member or watcher of a Group should feel comfortable reporting any activity to which they object on the basis of this Etiquette Policy or otherwise. We are not responsible for the conduct of Group participants or administrators. However, the Group applications permit us to take appropriate action should intervention become necessary as a result of a violation of the Terms of Service in general or of any other of our policies. Keep in mind that Group administrators may determine their own rules and privileges for deviants who participate in the Group and as a general rule we will not become involved in any disputes between Group members, between Group administrators or between one or another Group unless there is a clear violation of our own policies, rules and terms. We suggest you use good judgment and decency in all of your Group interactions as well as exercising the same cautions you would use in any Internet exchanges with individuals who you may not know. Further helpful information about Groups can be found in this FAQ and elsewhere on deviantART. Changes in Etiquette Policy As new situations come to our attention we may find it necessary to alter or expand upon the policies stated here with little or no notification and any such changes may be enforced in full against previously existing submissions or behavior. Alterations of policy may be announced through either the deviantART Status Forum or through other Announcements and News Topics. Appeals and Inquiries Appeals, inquiries, or questions concerning deviation removals, violation notices, account suspensions, or other administrative actions should be addressed to the official deviantART Helpdesk where they will be forwarded to the appropriate department for review. Please refrain from using the deviantART Forums, the deviantART Note system or personal email to staff members for these concerns. You are unlikely to receive a proper response and will be redirected to use the official Helpdesk. Petitions and other forms of public outcry are discouraged and will have no affect on Managerial Reviews of staff actions and may in fact be detrimental to the case in question. \xc2\xa92013 deviantART.

Anyhow taking a small break from teh commmission I\'m working on which is almost done. Anyhow my boyfriend is a retired goverment accountant who worked for the Detroit Police Department in Michigan before retiring and moving here to Washington State and start a Landlord business. He owns two houses and rents them out. We just got the tenant in the other house kicked out, he was renting the whole house and tried to leave with the keys, gave my boyfriend the finger when he left too. The other house he owns, the one we are currently in and supposed to be moving out, is a four bedroom two bathroom. He rents out these rooms to people for extra money a month and he seems to find the worst poor mooching people in history. Granted he\'s doing a nice thing by inviting strangers into his home for money, but the least they could do is show how greatful they are and CLEAN UP AFTER THEMSELVES. The vast majority of these people are lazy slobs. They don\'t pick up after themselves, they leave the bathroom they share a complete mess and sometimes try to use my boyfriend and I\'s bathroom. Then there\'s the stealing. Mostly it\'s FOOD STEALING. Dear Gosh we have to keep our own fridge in our room and keep our food here otherwise they WILL STEAL AND EAT IT!! And to make matters worse, they don\'t clean up the dishes. They complain about a messy house despite they are the ones that make the mess which My boyfriend and I are constantly cleaning up after them. He is the landlord I\'m the landlord\'s girlfriend for fucks sake we are NOT BUTLERS/BUTTLERESSES. Oh and you would think a poor person that has nothing but food stamps and maybe SSI would be grateful about having food in the house? THese people are PICKY they want ONLY THE BEST yet they can\'t afford it so they steal it. Funny thing is, 90% of the time they don\'t go out and get food because most of them can\'t drive and don\'t have cars. So what do they do? The most responsible of them try to mooch rides to the store from either myself or my boyfriend and they don\'t pay gas. If we do give them the ride to the store under the guise we will be eating some of that food, they make the food for themselves and eat it without sharing....Then they return to stealing our food. My boyfriend and I are the ones who bring in food currently, I have yet to see the current tenants bring anything in for awhile. Be in mind these people are not 20 or 30 somethings, these people ARE IN THEIR 40\'S AND 50\'S!!!! They are adults but they act like spoilt children who maybe at one point were successful but either fell on hard times, got involved with partying alchohol, spent all their money, or just got some disability that prohibts them from working or actively seeking jobs. Though this doesn\'t stop them from watching tv and playing WORLD OF WARCRAFT all day. Some of them have even tried \'buying\' the $3 movies to which Dave pays for the Comcast in all 4 rooms plus living room. They don\'t ask before they do this. We have a couple here that believes in one of the most grossest kitchen things I have heard off. The counter dish rack is where one puts dishes washed by hand to dry. This is what the rack is meant for. What the couple does is place DIRTY dishes on the Dish Rack even MIXING THEM WITH CLEAN DISHES to \'Await\' putting them into the Dishwasher. And by \'Await\' it really means wait for my boyfriend Dave or I to put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher after putting the clean ones away. These poor people also have a nasty habbit of either stealing Dave and I\'s dishes, breaking them and not replacing them, or both. It\'s got so bad I had to go to Walmart and spent about $20 for a box of glasses just so I could have something to use to put my chocolate milk in. They made sure to use those too. We have sponges meant for handwashing dishes and wiping down the surrounding counters. Sometimes one of the older tenants takes a sponge and goes somewhere cleaning something and returns said sponge to the sink. You would think one would wash out said sponge after cleaning? Nope not these people. They LEAVE DIRTY SPONGES AT THE SINK. Apparently they don\'t know how to pull the lever up to activate the water then wrinse and wringe or even put said sponge with the dirty dishes in the dishwasher to be cleaned. Sometimes when they bake food in the oven they will remove the food off the pan once it\'s done cooking and put it on their plates but they will leave the dirty pan in the oven and the pot holders EVERYWHERE.... Not only can we not keep our food out there ((even if we put our names on it they will still use it/eat it without asking)) we also can\'t keep our coffee filters or laundry soap out there. THe laundry room is right by the kitchen, if we leave our soap out there they will use it. One bitch almost broke the washing machine by using DISH SOAP! DISH.FUCKING.SOAP! You don\'t use Dish soap in the washer as it will BREAK THE MACHINE! And when you talk to them about it they will respond with the following: "Not my fault" "Well it\'s old" "I can\'t do that!" "I\'m poor!" These people aren\'t paying for room and board they are paying for room. They actually have to provide their own Food/bathroom soaps, laundry soaps and because we will be moving soon THEIR OWN DISHES AND POTS/PANS. I got so pissed off with 3 of them when I made my coffee every day for work. I would go finish getting ready for work and leave the coffee pot making the coffee. I would come back about 30 minutes later to check on the coffee to find out my coffee had been drank/poored out and someone else\'s coffee put in it\'s place. This was done by using MY BOYFRIEND AND I\'S COFFEE FILTERS and HIS COFFEE. At least have some fucking respect for your Landlord and his Girlfriend. But they don\'t. Because of their ages ((between 40-50\'s)) they think they can walk all over me because I\'m 27. I have a car and a license as well as my own job, and their are times they try to talk down to me like I\'m a little bitch or something. One 500 pound fat fuck even tried to kidnap my cat when we kicked her out of the house because she kept breaking stuff including one of the bedroom doors and the toilet seat which she didn\'t pay for because she was too poor. She also stole our food, particuarly mine, and then yelled at me whenever I was eating my food and accused me of \'stealing\' it. Damnit Dave, get back home and work with me here, I want to move out and I HATE LIVING WITH TENANTS ESPECIALLY POOR DISRESPECTFUL ONES THAT SHOULD BE GREATFUL. Oh you\'re going to love this. The couple we have here who are both on SSI and their children, including their Year old baby, don\'t live with them for one reason or another. They are picky about what they eat. They can\'t afford food much they say but they can afford World of Warcraft and $3 dollar videos on Comcast which they don\'t pay for, but they can\'t be bothered to get off their ass and go get food. They yell at Dave for brining home food that is almost expired or is not the right brand. IF YOU DON\'T LIKE IT THEN GET OFF YOUR LAZY ASS AND GO GET A JOB. OH WAIT, YOU WON\'T BE ABLE TO PLAY WORLD OF FAILCRAFT ANYMORE AND YOU\'LL LOOSE YOUR SSI. Which isn\'t much concidering they didn\'t pay much into SSI and are of the many poor people that chooses to fail and not do anything because they don\'t want to. End rant/Wall of Text. TL R Poor people steal and then complain when they don\'t get what they want on top of leaving a mess in the kitchen which they don\'t clean up but expect you to clean up after them even if you are their landlord. They also demand the best food and are not grateful with what\'s there or that my boyfriend allows them to take some food on which they steal the rest without asking. They steal laundry soap as well, break stuff, and one almost kidnapped my cat Midna. Reply Devious Comments ( Add yours ) Load All Images ~ HelloAmerica 1 hour ago \xc2\xa0 Hobbyist Photographer you type so much Reply ` thetaoofchaos 4 hours ago \xc2\xa0 Hobbyist Writer I think your rant is about inconsiderate/selfish people rather than about poor people. \xc2\xa0You can find the former in just about any social/financial demographic. Reply ~ SweetNspooky 4 hours ago \xc2\xa0 Student Traditional Artist Omfg, Ok so when i was poor i didnt remember being such an asshole but thanks. Reply ~ SweetNspooky 4 hours ago \xc2\xa0 Student Traditional Artist People are usually like that when they live with others. Most people are selfish cunts . And i speak by experience, Its not because they\'re poor. I lived a year with someone that made 3 times my salary, and was doing the same steal- break .. eating my food .. When someone does just have $30 to make a grocery and you eat his food its cheap ass . Then he does his grocery and mark his food !!!!!! But he did just eaten all mine ? He made me pay my rent when i moved out. for the rest of the loan because he was "Broke" and i wasent even on the rent document ... Las time i checked his bank account (Yup im a spy) He has over $12,000 .. He smoked all my cigarettes for a year stealing my weed... drank my redbulls .. Stealing my internet and busted the limit to download porn. He never gaved me a sigle dime and i paid all that stuff with 9,50$ an hour 20 hour aa week . RICH ARE CUNTS TOO. Reply ~ CrunchBandicoot 5 hours ago \xc2\xa0 Hobbyist General Artist I\'m sorry that you and your husband are dealing with this problem. I don\'t understand why people who are renting your house are stealing things (including an attempt to kidnap your cat), making messes, mooching for car rides, etc. and expect YOU to shrug it off every time they pull this shit. I hope you and your boyfriend can resolve the issue soon (preferably evicting those twits). Reply ~ DarkFox37 7 hours ago \xc2\xa0\n\n'

After manufacture, each Finalist will receive 20 T-Shirts with their winning design, which the Finalist may give or sell to others at their option. In addition, each time a Finalist\xe2\x80\x99s Entry is used on a new type of garment (e.g. a hat or a hoodie) the Finalist will receive an additional $500 (U.S. Dollars) per garment type as a one-time payment. No additional payments will be made for other uses of the Entry (e.g. a sticker or a lanyard) B. The Finalists will be selected as follows: Each Entry once submitted will be activated to receive community votes; Voting on the basis of whether a member of deviantART would want a T-Shirt with your design on it will be permitted on an Entry starting July 25, 2012 and ending on July 31, 2012. Votes may be changed by the voter at any time until the voting period ends; Voting will be frozen and tabulated on July 31, 2012 at 11:59 PM Los Angeles, CA, time. The top One Hundred (100) qualifying Entries measured by number of votes will be considered Semi-Finalist (In the event you have more than one Entry in the Top One Hundred (100) qualifying Entries only your top vote-getting Entry will qualify); The Semi-Finalists will be presented to the deviantART community and in the event a Semi-Finalist is removed as a result of valid objections to its qualifications, the next Entry in line (e.g.: the 101st ranking Entry) will become a Semi-Finalist; DeviantART staff judges will then select the two Finalists from the One Hundred (100) Semi-Finalists. The judges selection will be on the basis of (1) the originality and creativity of the design, (2) the design\xe2\x80\x99s appeal as presented on a bag intended for all ages and genders, (3) the design\xe2\x80\x99s success at conveying the theme of the challenge. The staff judges may consider, but need not consider the number of votes received by an Entry by a Semi-Finalist in determining Finalists; The TWO Finalists Entries will be made available on T-Shirts through the deviantART Shop. 9. VERIFICATION OF FINALISTS: Finalists may be asked as a condition of his or her selection to sign an additional document to further transfer the necessary rights to his or her Entry and to confirm its qualification. Finalists under the age of legal consent in his or her jurisdiction may require the signature of a parent or legal guardian. Finalists agree to the use of his or her username in promoting the sale of items containing the Finalist\xe2\x80\x99s Entry. 10. GENERAL: The Design Challenge is void in any place where it may be prohibited or restricted by law and will remain available elsewhere in the event a specific jurisdiction restricts it. DeviantART is responsible for conducting the Design Challenge under these Terms and Conditions but will not be responsible for any liability or damages that result to or from any computer, computer system, delay, mistakes or failure in the availability of the website to receive Entries or to receive and tabulate votes.

S'Cubism Design Challenge NO PURCHASE NECESSARY TO PARTICIPATE, TO VOTE OR TO BE SELECTED. ENTRIES TO THE CUBISM MESSENGER BAG DESIGN CHALLENGE MUST BE RECEIVED BY 11:59:59 PM (Los Angeles, CA time) ON June 12, 2012. 1. ELIGIBILITY: You must be a member of deviantART to submit an Entry or to vote. Membership is free by registration at www.deviantART.com/join . You must be age 13 or older at the time your Entry is made. You may be a resident of any country in the world. Membership in deviantART does not automatically enter you in the Challenge. DeviantART staff and volunteers and members of their immediate families may not make Entries for this Design Challenge. 2. HOW TO VOTE: To vote for an Entry click the words "I Want This" for the Entry you wish to vote for. You may vote for as many Entries as you wish, but you can only vote once for any Entry. 3. HOW TO ENTER: To enter the Challenge, you must follow these steps: Download the assets or templates provided (or their equivalent) for this Challenge from the links provided on the Design Challenge Page ; Create an Entry that conforms exactly to the creative and technical instructions for this Challenge in Section 4, below, and that meets the requirements for qualification in Section 5, below; Submit your Entry as directed in the Design Challenge Page ; You may enter as frequently as you like but only one of your Entries may be chosen as a semi-finalist and/or finalist; Your Entry will not be returned to you so keep the original file; Your Entry must be received before 11:59:59 PM (Los Angeles, CA, time) on June 12, 2012. 4. CREATIVE AND TECHNICAL GUIDELINES: Your Entry must follow these guidelines: Create an original design for a messenger bag flap in the style of Cubism; For this challenge we are defining Cubism as a style of art in which instead of depicting objects from one viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from multiple viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context. Often the surfaces intersect at seemingly random angles, removing a coherent sense of depth. The background and object planes interpenetrate one another to create a shallow ambiguous space. You must use the messenger bag templates provided for download (or their equivalent) at the Design Challenge Page ; You must limit your design to only the front flap print area (below the zipper). You may not include any images that were created by other artists, past or present. Entries containing copyrighted or trademarked images are also prohibited. Third party stock may not be used. You may only use a maximum of 4 colors in your design. You may not change the color of the bag(s) as presented in the templates. 5. A QUALIFIED ENTRY: To qualify to win this Challenge your Entry: Must follow the Creative and Technical Guidelines; Must be completely your original work with the exception of the messenger bag template provided to you for download from the Design Challenge Page ; May not contain any stock images unless it is stock imagery you yourself have created on your own (licensed stock brushes and textures are acceptable); May not have been previously entered or used in any other contest or Challenge outside of deviantART in whole or in part or offered for sale; May not be a collaboration with another person; Must follow deviantART\'s Etiquette and Submission policies; May not contain logos, trademarks, names of other businesses and enterprises or catch phrases associated with other businesses or enterprises. Logos, symbols (such as fella or llama), trademarks and catch phrases of deviantART are permitted; May not infringe the copyrights, trademarks or personality rights of any third party; Should not contain any artist signatures or watermarks unless intended to be part of the artwork for the Entry and to be judged as part of the Entry; May not contain the name and likeness of another person unless he or she will and can sign an appropriate release for the unconditional use of his or her name and likeness; The messenger bag color choices are Black and Grey in the downloadable templates. You may not alter the color of the bag for your design. Must be submitted to the "Cubism Messenger Bag Design Challenge" Gallery on or before 11:59:59 PM (Los Angeles, CA, time) on June 12, 2012. 6. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT: By submitting an Entry, you represent and warrant: That you have the absolute and unrestricted right to submit the Entry as your sole work under the Terms and Conditions of the Design Challenge; All images of people or names of people that appear in the Entry, if any, have unconditionally granted to you the right to use their respective names or images for the Entry without any additional compensation to be paid for those rights and you will produce a signed grant on request; Other than the assets provided for download from the Design Challenge Page, the Entry and every part of the Entry does not infringe on any intellectual property rights or other property interests of any other person, company or enterprise. 7. YOUR CONTINUING RIGHTS TO YOUR ENTRY: You will own all rights to your Entry as if it was a submission to your deviantART gallery, including the right to delete the Entry; You will obtain no rights to use any of the assets provided for download from the Design Challenge Page except as part of an Entry made for the challenge which you can continue to display on deviantART as your work even after the conclusion of the Design Challenge; If your Entry is selected as a Finalist, you will automatically grant to deviantART for a period of ten years the following rights: the exclusive right to use the Entry as a design for and on goods or services including the right to use the Entry to promote the goods or services on which it is used and/or to use the Entry to promote deviantART itself anywhere in the world and in all media; the exclusive right to change, adapt, alter and combine the Entry for and in connection with any of the exclusive rights you have granted to deviantART; the exclusive right to display and distribute the Entry in any medium throughout the world.

If your Entry is selected as a Finalist you understand and agree that deviantART may adapt and alter your Entry to use it in connection with goods and services; If your Entry is not selected as a Finalist, you may continue to post your Entry in your deviantART gallery unaltered and you may otherwise use all or any of the elements in your Entry in any way and in any manner as the copyright owner of the Entry; DeviantART may display any Entry until it is deleted as part of or as being associated with the Design Challenge on off the deviantART website; DeviantART may solicit voting and comments in any manner for an Entry submitted to the Design Challenge. 8. SELECTION OF THE TWO FINALISTS AND CASH AWARD: A. TWO Finalists will be selected and each will be offered $1,500 (U.S. Dollars) for the right to use their Entry as set out in section 6, above.

In addition, each time a Finalist\'s Entry is used on a new type of garment (e.g. a hat or a hoodie) the Finalist will receive an additional $500 (U.S. Dollars) per garment type as a one-time payment. No additional payments will be made for other uses of the Entry (e.g. a sticker or a lanyard) B. The Finalists will be selected as follows: Each Entry once submitted will be activated to receive community votes; Voting on the basis of whether a member of deviantART would use a messenger bag with your design on it will be permitted on an Entry starting as soon as it is submitted and ending on June 17, 2012. Votes may be changed by the voter at any time until the voting period ends; Voting will be frozen and tabulated on June 17, 2012 at 11:59 PM Los Angeles, CA, time. The top One Hundred (100) qualifying Entries measured by number of votes will be considered Semi-Finalist (In the event you have more than one Entry in the Top One Hundred (100) qualifying Entries only your top vote-getting Entry will qualify); The Semi-Finalists will be presented to the deviantART community and in the event a Semi-Finalist is removed as a result of valid objections to its qualifications, the next Entry in line (e.g.: the 101st ranking Entry) will become a Semi-Finalist; DeviantART staff judges will then select the two Finalists from the One Hundred (100) Semi-Finalists. The judges selection will be on the basis of (1) the originality and creativity of the design, (2) the design\'s appeal as presented on a bag intended for all ages and genders, (3) the design\'s ability to appropriately use cubism as a design style. The staff judges may consider but need not consider the number of votes received by an Entry by a Semi-Finalist in determining Finalists; The two Finalists Entries will be made available on Messenger Bags through the deviantART store. 9. VERIFICATION OF FINALISTS: Finalists may be asked as a condition of his or her selection to sign an additional document to further transfer the necessary rights to his or her Entry and to confirm its qualification. Finalists under the age of legal consent in his or her jurisdiction may require the signature of a parent or legal guardian. Finalists agree to the use of his or her username in promoting the sale of items containing the Finalist\'s Entry. 10.

Circa. FEB 17, 2010 ABOUT ~Toon Up is an invitation only group of top notch artists that have an extra special skill for drawing the female form in an exceptional manner. The art is fun, sexy and has that "X" factor to it! NO, I don\'t mean in a pornographic way. ~We DON\'T accept nudity in any submissions as a general rule, we want to reach as big an audience as we can. ~The artists contributing their work to TOON-UP want to bring you the best viewing experience possible, so we just can\'t accept anything less. So, for those that are not a direct part of TOON-UP, please do NOT be offended if any of your submissions are not accepted. It is NOT because you suck or anything... it\'s probably due to the particular work not fitting in with what we are looking to present.

OK Favourites Humans Becoming Robots, Robots Becoming Human On March 1, 2012 the Nevada DMV issued the first license for a \xe2\x80\x9cGoogle Driverless Car.\xe2\x80\x9d The idea behind this innovation is that one day soon new technology will drive cars safer and more skillfully than humans, thus saving lives and billions of dollars in car crashes. How well this idea catches on is a bit questionable, given the powerful \xe2\x80\x9cromance\xe2\x80\x9d of driving one\xe2\x80\x99s car, but it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly an indicator of things to come in the daily intersection of human and artificial intelligence and mobility. There have always been those who have dreamed of stepping into a mechanical exo-skeletal-type \xe2\x80\x9csuit\xe2\x80\x9d and letting the engineering do the work, instantly increasing limited human speed, strength, endurance and accuracy.
