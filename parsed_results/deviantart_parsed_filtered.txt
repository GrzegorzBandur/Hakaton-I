The bottom line is: Just about anything that is on this site, on the web, on TV, on CD\'s, on DVD\'s, in books & in magazines is probably copyrighted by someone. Copyright can be a confusing territory for many people. In many cases the natural confusion over the sometimes varied circumstances surrounding copyright will lead people to rely on rumor or myth more often than the actual law which naturally confuses the matter even more. In this document we will attempt to eliminate some of the confusion and counter many of the myths surrounding copyright and to present clearly the deviantART policies and practices with regard to copyright. The availability of this document should not be construed as rendering legal or other professional advice, and this document is not a substitute for the advice of an attorney. If you require legal advice, you should seek the services of a qualified attorney. How do I get Copyright? Under most national laws and international copyright treaties you receive a copyright automatically in any original work as you make it. Registration may be required to exercise some rights, like commencing a lawsuit. Copyright does NOT protect ideas. Copyright protects the expression of ideas or the ways in which an idea is materially placed or expressed in the work. What is Copyright Infringement? To simplify this question, copyright infringement occurs when you do certain things with a creative work which someone else produced without first getting the proper permission. Some examples of copyright infringement (this is only a partial listing) can include: Placing someone else\'s photograph or creative work online without proper permission. Using a creative work commercially without permission. Adapting someone else\'s creative work found in one medium to another medium, such as making a book into a movie or a photograph into a painting. Modifying or editing a creative work without proper permission. How Can I Avoid Infringing on Someone\'s Copyright? The best way to avoid infringing on the rights of another creative person is to use your skill, talent and imagination to create your own completely original work. When we use the word \'original\' we don\'t mean that you must come up with an idea which hasn\'t been used before - recall that copyright does not protect ideas. When used in reference to copyright "original" means that you created your work without referencing or deliberately copying anyone else\'s work during the process. Ensure that all parts of your work, both visual and audio, are your own original creations. If you have used materials which are owned by other people or companies make certain that you have obtained proper permission or licensing for the use before you place your work online. You can also obtain permission to use a copyrighted work by license. You can read more here and here . What Sort of Things are Copyrighted? The easy answer to this question is that just about any creative work that is less than 150 years old you might find should be considered copyrighted by default. A work is not required to have a copyright statement printed on it or near it in order to be considered copyrighted so do not assume that the work is unprotected simply because you cannot see a notice written anywhere. Also do not confuse the fact that a work is publicly available with the idea that it is in the public domain or free for use. Being easy to find on the internet does not affect a work\'s copyrighted status. There are many exceptions to the 150 year guideline, but you are best advised to obtain legal advice from an expert if you intend to rely on the possibility that a modern work is not copyrighted. Some Cautions In most cases it does not matter how much of the material you have used, whether it\'s a single frame, a few moments of audio, a short clip of video or any other sampling it\'s still considered to be protected by copyright and you still require the owner\'s permission for use. It doesn\'t matter how you obtained the material, it\'s still considered copyrighted and you still need permission. It doesn\'t matter whether or not you\'ve credited the proper owner, it\'s still considered copyrighted and you still need permission. It doesn\'t matter if you are not selling it or making a profit, it\'s still considered copyrighted and you still need permission. It doesn\'t matter if you can find other people using things without permission, it\'s still considered copyrighted and you still need permission. It doesn\'t matter if you\'ve edited it a little bit or made a few alterations, if it\'s recognizable it\'s still considered copyrighted and you still need permission. Read licenses carefully to understand the type of permission they provide. For example, there are many versions of the Creative Commons - each giving different permissions. What Happens When You Submit Infringing Works to deviantART? Any copyright owner following the procedures in this Copyright Policy can require deviantART to remove his or her copyrighted content in use by a member of deviantART. When through the proper notice we become aware that a submission to deviantART infringes upon the copyrights of another artist, creative person or company, we will immediately delete it. This is a legal requirement which we fulfill immediately; you will not receive an advanced warning and you will not be given an opportunity to \'fix it\'. If you believe that a submission on deviantART infringes on your copyright you may either report the submission using our internal reporting system or send us a copyright notice via mail or email. A member of staff will review your notice and act accordingly. If you believe that one of your submissions was removed in error you may contact our helpdesk or otherwise file a counter notice. If you are found to repeatedly post infringing content, your account will be suspended and serious offenders will have their account banned and deactivated. We consider three strikes as an indication of being a repeat infringer subject to ban. If you are found deliberately misrepresenting the copyrighted work of another as your own your account will be immediately banned and deactivated. The copyright owner may also decide to sue you directly if you infringe his or her copyright in posting content to deviantART. What about "Fair Use" "Fair Use" is the notion that some public and private uses of copyrighted works should not require the permission of a copyright owner. These circumstances are very limited, complex to analyze under the law and require the help of expert advice from a lawyer. We recommend you talk to your own lawyer if you want to know more about fair use as it applies to the work you are doing. If it turns out that it isn\'t fair use, you may be liable for very serious money damages. To learn more about fair use you can go here , here , here , and here . If you take my work down am I protected from a lawsuit? No. Even if deviantART takes an infringing work down, you may still be responsible for very significant damages if the copyright owner decides to sue you. Notification of Copyright Infringement Instructions for Copyright Owners This section contains the formal requirements of the Copyright Act with respect to the rights of copyright owners whose content appears on deviantART without authorization and instruction to copyright owners. To file a copyright infringement notification with deviantART (also commonly known as a "DMCA takedown notice"), the copyright owner or an authorized agent acting on his or her behalf will need to send a written communication that includes substantially the following: 1. A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. 2.

No additional payments will be made for other uses of the Entry (e.g. a sticker or a lanyard) B.

After manufacture, each Finalist will receive 10 Hooded Sweatshirts, which the Finalist may give or sell to others at his or her option. In addition, each time a Finalist\'s Entry is used on a new type of garment (e.g. a hat or a t-shirt) the Finalist will receive an additional $500 (U.S. Dollars) per garment type as a one-time payment. No additional payments will be made for other uses of the Entry (e.g. a sticker or a lanyard) B. The Finalists will be selected as follows: Each Entry once submitted will be activated to receive community votes; Voting on the basis of whether a member of deviantART would wear a design on a Hooded Sweatshirt will be permitted on an Entry starting as soon as it is submitted and ending on April 13th, 2012 . Votes may be changed by the voter at any time until the voting period ends; Voting will be frozen and tabulated on April 13th, 2012 at 11:59 PM Los Angeles, CA, time. The top One Hundred (100) qualifying Entries measured by number of votes will be considered Semi-Finalist (In the event you have more than one Entry in the top One Hundred (100) qualifying Entries only your top vote getting Entry will qualify); In the event you have more than one Entry in the Top One Hundred (100) qualifying Entries only your top vote getting Entry will qualify; The Semi-Finalists will be presented to the deviantART community and in the event a Semi-Finalist is removed as a result of valid objections to its qualifications, the next Entry in line (e.g.: the 101st ranking Entry) will become a Semi-Finalist; DeviantART staff judges will then select two Finalists from the One Hundred (100) Semi-Finalists. The judges selection will be on the basis of (1) the originality and creativity of the design, (2) the design\'s appeal as presented on a garment intended for all sizes and genders, (3) the design\'s successful representation of the 8-Bit graphic style. "8-Bit" for the purpose of this Design Challenge means a style that is pixilated and in which each pixel represented in the design is clearly defined graphically. Each pixel should be uniform to the other pixels in the design and each pixel should contain only one color per pixel. There is no official requirement on the total number of pixels, size of pixels, or color of pixels required for your original design. The term "8-Bit" is not intended in its technical, exact meaning and is used to evoke a design "look" inspired by 8-Bit designs. Examples of 8-Bit design will be provided in the Creative Brief and Tips download; The staff judges may consider, but need not consider the number of votes received by an Entry by Semi-Finalist in determining Finalists; The two Finalist\'s Entries will be made available on Hooded Sweatshirts through the deviantWEAR store. 9. VERIFICATION OF FINALISTS: Finalists may be asked as a condition of his or her selection to sign an additional document to further transfer the necessary rights to his or her Entry and to confirm its qualification. Finalists under the age of legal consent in his or her jurisdiction may require the signature of a parent or legal guardian. Finalists agree to the use of his or her username in promoting the sale of items containing the Finalist\'s Entry. 10. GENERAL: The Design Challenge is void in any place where it may be prohibited or restricted by law and will remain available elsewhere in the event a specific jurisdiction restricts it. DeviantART is responsible for conducting the Design Challenge under these Terms and Conditions but will not be responsible for any liability or damages that result to or from any computer, computer system, delay, mistakes or failure in the availability of the website to receive Entries or to receive and tabulate votes. DeviantART reserves the right in its sole discretion, to modify, cancel, terminate or suspend the Design Challenge should any virus, bug, technical failures, unauthorized human intervention or other causes beyond its reasonable control corrupt or affect the administration, security, fairness or proper conduct of the Design Challenge. CAUTION: ANY ATTEMPT BY AN ENTRANT TO DELIBERATELY DAMAGE ANY WEBSITE OR UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMATE OPERATION OF THIS DESIGN CHALLENGE OR ITS VOTING PROCESS IS A VIOLATION OF CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LAWS. SHOULD SUCH AN ATTEMPT BE MADE, deviantART RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SEEK DAMAGES FROM ANY SUCH INDIVIDUAL TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND TO DISQUALIFY ANY ENTRIES SUBMIT BY SUCH AN ENTRANT. In the event any Entry is found to be fraudulent or an unlawful appropriation of the work of another or in violation of any representation made in connection with the submission of the Entry, deviantART reserves the right to pursue any and all remedies against the member responsible for such an Entry.

OK Favourites Humans Becoming Robots, Robots Becoming Human On March 1, 2012 the Nevada DMV issued the first license for a \xe2\x80\x9cGoogle Driverless Car.\xe2\x80\x9d The idea behind this innovation is that one day soon new technology will drive cars safer and more skillfully than humans, thus saving lives and billions of dollars in car crashes. How well this idea catches on is a bit questionable, given the powerful \xe2\x80\x9cromance\xe2\x80\x9d of driving one\xe2\x80\x99s car, but it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly an indicator of things to come in the daily intersection of human and artificial intelligence and mobility.
