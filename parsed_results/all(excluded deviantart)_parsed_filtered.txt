S'Is Apple\xe2\x80\x99s Magic Officially Gone? | DailyTekk Advertise About Buzz Contact Partners DailyTekk Gadgets + Startups + Social Media + Apps + Internet March 4, 2013 Should Tech Companies Employ Remote Workers? Think Tank 0 February 28, 2013 Inside Flipboard Company X 0 February 25, 2013 Infographic: How Attached Are We To Our Computers? Guest Posts 3 February 1, 2013 Inside Spotify: My All-Time Favorite Music Service (Lots of Pics) Apps 3 Editorial Think Tank Series Understanding Company X Product Y Startup Stories Game of Fame Innovators Picture Interview The Platform Topics Social Media Startups Apple Mobile Gadgets Top 100 Lists Reviews Roundups Guests DSCVR Think Tank November 12, 2012 Is Apple\xe2\x80\x99s Magic Officially Gone? Most people seem to think Apple will always be the Apple so many people have come to know and love in recent years, but Steve Jobs would be the first person to remind us that even the mighty can fall (and fall hard). With the introduction of the iPad Mini, could Apple be starting back down the slippery slope of merely tweaking existing products instead of inventing groundbreaking new ones? As you probably know, one of the very first things Steve Jobs did when he returned to Apple and became the iCEO was to kill off the multiple products with slight variations and confusing naming schemes to concentrate on a few very focused products instead. The era of Steve may have indeed officially ended as it has been reported that the iPhone 5 was the last product he had any active input in. While the iPad Mini will certainly sell well, fewer people queued up outside Apple stores to be the first to buy the device when compared to other recent and memorable Apple product launches such as the first iPad or any iPhone premier. If nothing else, the iPad Mini launch, a falling stock price driven by a recent executive shakeup and parody videos galore provide an opportunity for Apple employees, analysts and fans alike to question whether or not the company still has the magic touch. Does Jony Ive have any foam models locked away in his secure workspace that can still truly surprise? Can Apple pull off the tricky yet necessary content deals needed to make the long awaited iTV a dazzling reality? Is Tim Cook simply a stellar manager or can he prove his mettle as a superb innovator (or at the very least manage to enable other serious innovators to thrive)? Will Apple continue to be the one to out-innovate its own product lineup before competitors even have a chance as it has in the recent past? In short, is real innovation dead at Apple? To help you make up your mind, here\xe2\x80\x99s what the our Tech Think Tank has to say on the matter: No: Apple\xe2\x80\x99s Team is Too Talented to Fail They say success has many parents, and failure is an orphan. With innovation, the mythology is reversed: great ideas erupt spontaneously from lonely tortured tyrant-geniuses working from their parents\xe2\x80\x99 garages, while failed products are built by faceless droning committees and expensive marketing agencies. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t buy it. A singular vision can buoy a company, but the success of Apple still resides in its team: designers, developers, and engineers. While schadenfreude may be entertaining, the talent at Apple\xe2\x80\x99s disposal sets the odds against a looming end to their reign. Ryan\xc2\xa0Merkley\xc2\xa0 ( @ryanmerkley ) \xc2\xa0is Chief Operating Officer at\xc2\xa0 Mozilla , where he recently launched the\xc2\xa0 Webmaker \xc2\xa0initiative, helping users of the web become makers of the web. Yes: Without Jobs Who Will Say No? I think Apple is through.\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve been bearish on them since Jobs died. Not because I think he was a product visionary, or that it matters that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t touch the next product, but because I think he inspired others. He was a great salesman of things and ideas. He sold a clear and compelling vision for products, both internally and externally. Without that, Apple will devolve into multiple product lines and competing visions\xe2\x80\x94like they did in the past.\xc2\xa0I took a class in college called, Without God, is All Permitted? It was about ethics. Here, Without Jobs, is All Permitted? This is about proliferation of features. Who\xe2\x80\x99s to say \xe2\x80\x9cno?\xe2\x80\x9d Jon Stein ( @jonstein ) \xc2\xa0is the founder and CEO of Betterment \xc2\xa0and is passionate about helping people make smart decisions with their money. No: Stop Inventing Reasons Why Apple Has Fallen Steve Jobs has only been gone for a little over a year and the financial and tech communities are falling all over themselves inventing reasons why the mighty Apple has fallen. Apple is the most successful public company in recent memory. When you\xe2\x80\x99re at the top of the mountain, everyone tries to tear you down. Every little move is examined under a microscope and pundits come to all kinds of outlandish conclusions proclaiming the end is near for the most innovative and loved technology company of the last 40 years. To better answer the question of whether Apple\xe2\x80\x99s magic is gone, let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at the tech landscape since 2001. Name another company besides Apple that has redefined three major product categories over that time. You can\xe2\x80\x99t. By introducing the iPod, iPhone and iPad, Apple has single-handedly created three market-leading products that have become the standards by which all other competing devices are judged. When has that pace of innovation ever happened before? While it\xe2\x80\x99s true that companies like Samsung, Google and Amazon have made inroads in the smartphone and tablet markets, Apple remains to this day the leader. So it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to tell whether Apple\xe2\x80\x99s magic is beginning to wane. My sense is Apple has some interesting surprises up its sleeve for 2013 and beyond. The recent rush to rev the iPad and introduce the iPad Mini are signs they are clearing the decks to spotlight new, revolutionary products. My prediction is we\xe2\x80\x99ll see new products redefining how we watch television and continued advancements in making user interfaces much more intuitive including using voice and touch gestures. Technology is evolving at a tremendous pace and I foresee Apple at the head of the pack for years to come. Ann Tran ( @anntran_ )\xc2\xa0 is a key influencer across multiple social media platforms,\xc2\xa0 an avid\xc2\xa0 travel enthusiast \xc2\xa0and lover of anything involving technology. Yes: Apple Is In A Creative Rut Virality begins with creativity. When new products are introduced that are familiar to people then it\xe2\x80\x99s no longer innovative but a comparison. The release of Apple\xe2\x80\x99s iPad Mini didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the buzz or sales it was hoping for because it was a comparison to Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s Kindle Fire or Samsung\xe2\x80\x99s Galaxy Tab. We expect Apple to produce new products that are unexpected. The iPad Mini fell short of the expectations. Yes, I believe Apple is running out of ideas because rather than improving our life with innovative products, they are in a creative rut and focussing too much on improving product features that are widely expected. Unless a new iPhone can automatically drive my car\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m not impressed. Noland Hoshino ( @nolandhoshino ), Co-Founder and Do-Good Enforcer\xc2\xa0 Bcause Media . No: Apple Will Still Surprise and Excite Us All There is a great Steve Jobs quote \xe2\x80\x9cThe way we have succeeded is by choosing which horses to ride very carefully\xe2\x80\x9d. Apple isn\xe2\x80\x99t really about making things that are radically different for the sake of it but rather things that are designed, regardless of the status quo, to be as good as they can be for the task in hand. The iPhone started off being revolutionary and has continued to be the market leader since that day, the changes we see are small but impressive, such as the recent changes to the size and weight of the iPhone and iPad Mini. These iterative changes might not be headline worthy but do improve the experience for a consumer and the sales figures back this up. Sales figures of 3 million devices in the opening weekend for the iPad 4 and Mini are impressive when you consider it took 28 days to sell 1 million of the first generation of iPad. Apple hasn\xe2\x80\x99t lost its magic but there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a relevant horse to ride just yet. In the mean time they continue to make the best devices on the market better and when that horse arrives they will deliver it in a way that will surprise and excite us all. Matt Mills ( @mattmills ), Global Head of Partnerships and Innovation\xc2\xa0 Aurasma . No: Apple Can (And Should) Mine Big Data Apple\xe2\x80\x99s multi-product issue seems to be rearing it\xe2\x80\x99s ugly head again as the product giant scrambles to maintain consumer loyalty in a post-Jobs world, but their biggest issue is not their hardware products, it\xe2\x80\x99s their move to mobile data. It\xe2\x80\x99s no secret that Apple has been sitting on a treasure chest of mobile consumer data since they launched the iPhone, but they have failed to make use of that data in a way that can continue to benefit the company. They are going up against the likes of Google and Facebook in a race to master mobile data for the sake of advertising revenue and it\xe2\x80\x99s this rushed progress that is not only diluting the product, but weakening the brand. Case in point\xe2\x80\x94Apple Maps. So is innovation is dead at Apple? No\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s just been deemed low priority. Instead of keeping up with the Jones\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94who honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t have it all figured out anyway\xe2\x80\x94Apple should get their greatest minds together and develop a data-driven, revenue building product that will put them ahead of their big data competitors in the same way they pulled ahead in hardware. Lay low and get it right guys or don\xe2\x80\x99t bother at all. Annisa Farese ( LinkedIn ), Manager Marketing Communications xAd . What Do You Think?

Nice piece! I think you\xe2\x80\x99re likely right \xe2\x80\x93 TV next. Apple has been rooting around in this space for awhile (a \xe2\x80\x9chobby\xe2\x80\x9d in their own words). But I think we are at an adoption tipping point and if Apple can make it easy and seamless\xe2\x80\xa6.they can own this space too. Reply Erich Penhoff November 12, 2012 at 7:53 pm # Apple is experienced enough to use share value as a gage to measure their product. Steve Jobs did one thing immediately when he returned, he shed the excess of useles image creating items. The mini-pad is such a immage seekind devise. Remember there is no one at fault if you try. Watch the stock retreat and the product will improve. RIM has gone through the Asian assault on products too. Reply Layspace November 13, 2012 at 12:42 am # Yes precisely the mighty will fall. Apple is design and innovation driven, or is it? It\xe2\x80\x99s more money driven and power driven \xe2\x80\x93 and that already started while Jobs was still alive. Using iPad mini as a tell of being less innovative is silly: how about iPod, iPod mini, iPod large, iPod mini\xe2\x80\x99er iPod nano etc. Apple\xe2\x80\x99s decline has already started. It is alienating its core consumer, believer, base. It\xe2\x80\x99s becoming more and more a big brother \xe2\x80\x93 forcing the user into Apple\xe2\x80\x99s maze of money driven updates, upgrades and allowing less & less freedom of use. Making way for other producers to seduce that core fan base to start looking elsewhere. Reply Justanotherthought November 13, 2012 at 7:06 am # I would only add one thing. The marketing is going sour. To many choices. Why can i still choose between the ipad2, ipad3 and the now introduced mini. Same with powerbook with of without retina. As a potential customer i\xe2\x80\x99m in doubt. This is a bad marketing strategy. Doubt lets me consider other options. Kindle? Jobs made it easy. You buy the model of this moment. This model will remain hot for at least a year. Let the new features/design/services lift the doubt\xe2\x80\xa6 Jobs killed the Apple licensed clones. Please learn from earlier misstakes. Keep the productline simple. Don\xe2\x80\x99t make me think and doubt.

The Platform is an invitation-only guest opportunity that asks technologists and\xc2\xa0innovators\xc2\xa0to share big ideas. This week you are getting schooled by Brad Woodcox ( @bradwoodcox ),\xc2\xa0Director of Investment and Operations at HalberdCross who also serves as a Technical Specialist at Novak Druce Connolly Bove + Quigg LLP. The Internet connects people to an enormous wealth of information. This access facilitates the ability to learn new skills with relative ease compared to 30 years ago. However, just because you have access to relevant information and the ability to absorb it does not mean that learning a new business service skill is the best decision. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re born, you\xe2\x80\x99re born with 30,000 days. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. The best strategic planning I can give to you is to think about that.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Sir Ray Avery via TechCrunch . Scary to quantify it in those terms. Add to that, a typical person reading this article may have already used up 10,000 (or more) of these days. Since a person\xe2\x80\x99s time is so limited, making efficient decisions is paramount, unless you want to waste one or more of your 30,000 days. Within this finite number of days, a person will repeatedly be faced with a choice to tackle a problem alone or to hire the expertise of a professional service. These instances will span both a person\xe2\x80\x99s personal and professional life. Example situations include: It is the annual tax season. Should you purchase TurboTax or another computer tax program or should you hire a CPA/tax pro? You want to setup a new company. Should you utilize the state\xe2\x80\x99s website, purchase a package from one of the online LLC/corporation formation companies, or hire a local corporate attorney? You want to increase your company\xe2\x80\x99s online presence. Should you create your own website and social media accounts or should you hire a tech/social media consulting firm? Interestingly, the same question/problem can have different ideal responses based on the details of the situation. Despite these questions arising a multitude of times in a person\xe2\x80\x99s life, each instance is still often a tough decision on which path to take. The reasoning is perhaps best captured by former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say, we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns \xe2\x80\x93 the ones we don\xe2\x80\x99t know we don\xe2\x80\x99t know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93Donald Rumsfeld via Dept of Defense What is an \xe2\x80\x9cunknown unknown\xe2\x80\x9d to a novice may be a trivial or a \xe2\x80\x9cknown known\xe2\x80\x9d to a professional in the area. These are often pieces of information that can only be derived from years of experience and not from a short-term \xe2\x80\x9cBeginners Guide to \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d. To combat such situations, the following ten considerations are proposed to assist in developing a structured analysis and thought process that may highlight the \xe2\x80\x9cknown unknowns\xe2\x80\x9d or perhaps even suggest the presence of potential \xe2\x80\x9cunknown unknowns\xe2\x80\x9d: Time: How much time will it take you to learn the information and skills to do it yourself? How much time will it take to find and manage a professional? Money: What are the cost savings between doing it yourself and hiring a pro? Access: How accessible is information, instructions, or walk-throughs for completing the task? Quality: What kind of quality is required? Results & Consequences: What are the effects if the job is not performed correctly? What can be gained from a superb project? Reoccurrence: Will the skill set that needs to be learned benefit you in the future? Will you have to repeat this process/service? Rapid Change: How dynamic is this problem area and will the required skills change before you need to repeat/redo the service? Skill Transferability/Marketability: Would the skills learned be beneficial in other areas? How do the skills fit with your current expertise? Would the skills learned make you more attractive to an employer or client? Post Work: After the initial task is completed, will there be ongoing maintenance services required? Do professionals provide any guarantees? License/Certification: Do you need to be licensed or certified to perform the task? If you are facing a rarely used skill that has significant consequences and requires high quality (such as drafting an operating agreement for a new company), then you might decide to hire a pro. However, if you are facing a skill that has low barriers to entry and requires continual post work/development (such as updating your website or creating a corporate Twitter account and social presence), then you might decide to learn the required skills. Utilizing these considerations will hopefully help you manage your decision analysis and make better use of the remainder of your 30,000 days, whether you decide to do it yourself or hire a pro.

I don\xe2\x80\x99t spend time randomly surfing YouTube, and when given the choice between reading an article and watching a video, I\xe2\x80\x99ll read. The reason is that videos often don\xe2\x80\x99t work well for me: they\xe2\x80\x99re too fast or too slow, they take a long time to get to the point, they don\xe2\x80\x99t let me skip around and browse easily.

S'FlowingData | Data Visualization, Infographics, and Statistics Log in \xc2\xa0or\xc2\xa0 Become a Member Membership Tutorials Books Twitter Odds of a perfect NCAA March Madness bracket March 22, 2013 to Statistics by Nathan Yau Math professor Jeff Bergen explains the odds of picking a perfect bracket . The first probability is based on a 50/50 split of correct picks, which is like using fair coin flips to pick winners. Bergen doesn\'t really go into how he calculated the second probability, but that smaller number comes up by bumping up the probability of picking the right team for each game. I think he\'s using an average probability of slightly less than 70% (based on simulation results from this old Wall Street Journal column ). That\'s why businesses can offer up million dollar prizes. In all likelihood, no one is going to win, which turns out to be a great business model for insurance companies who back these contests : If millions of people enter a particular contest, it might seem like the chance of someone winning is suddenly in the realm of possibility. But there\'s a catch: This scenario assumes everyone maximized their chances by picking mostly favorites, so those with the best shot at winning are likely to have identical entries. These contests generally protect themselves from big losses by stating they\'ll divvy up the loot if there are multiple perfect brackets. These favorable conditions make insuring these prize offers a good business, as the Dallas company SCA Promotions has discovered. SCA, founded by 11-time world bridge champion Robert D. Hamman, has taken on the insurance risk for roughly 50 perfect-bracket prizes -- including a Sporting News offer of $1 million in 2001, according to vice president Chris Hamman, the founder\'s son. In the 12 years it has been doing so, SCA has never had to pay out a claim. A visualization of pi for high school math students March 22, 2013 to Data Art by Nathan Yau On Kickstarter: A project that uses a visualization of pi to connect Brooklyn high school students to their community . They\'ve already made a histogram of emotions in their school\'s hallway and a stacked area chart mural at a nearby senior center. Next up is a wall currently covered in graffiti. In Math class, students will construct the golden spiral based on the Fibonacci Sequence and begin to explore the relationship between the golden ratio and Pi. The number Pi will be represented in a color-coded graph within the golden spiral. In this, the numbers will be seen as color blocks that vary in size proportionately within the shrinking space of the spiral, allowing us to visualize the shape of Pi and it\'s negative space. Backed. Internet Census March 22, 2013 to Statistical Visualization by Nathan Yau Upon discovering hundreds of thousands open embedded devices on the Internet, an anonymous researcher conducted a Census of the Internet, mapping 460 million IP addresses around the world . While playing around with the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) we discovered an amazing number of open embedded devices on the Internet. Many of them are based on Linux and allow login to standard BusyBox with empty or default credentials. We used these devices to build a distributed port scanner to scan all IPv4 addresses. These scans include service probes for the most common ports, ICMP ping, reverse DNS and SYN scans. We analyzed some of the data to get an estimation of the IP address usage. It\'s a pretty thorough analysis, but the conclusion interested me most: The why is also simple: I did not want to ask myself for the rest of my life how much fun it could have been or if the infrastructure I imagined in my head would have worked as expected. I saw the chance to really work on an Internet scale, command hundred thousands of devices with a click of my mouse, portscan and map the whole Internet in a way nobody had done before, basically have fun with computers and the Internet in a way very few people ever will. I decided it would be worth my time. It makes me feel...uneasy. [Thanks, Roger] Declining songwriter ratings with age March 21, 2013 to Statistics by Nathan Yau Do singer-songwriters age well like a fine wine, or does quality decline with age? Kyle Biehle analyzed fan ratings by age . I understand all of the reasons for not comparing artists in this way. Despite twenty-one Academy Award nominations, Woody Allen never attends the Oscars. His reason is that art isn\'t competition \xe2\x80\x94 judging art is so subjective who\'s to say who or what is best? After all one man\'s Poison is another man\'s Cream. Similarly, Elvis Costello (featured in the viz) is famously credited with saying: "Writing about music is like dancing about architecture - It\'s a really stupid thing to want to do." I agree that using ratings - whether from fans or critics \xe2\x80\x94 to judge artistic merit is at best flawed and at worst a fool\'s exercise. But I wanted to do it anyway. Most peak in their 20s and either stabilize later on or continue to decline. Occasionally, as in the case with Bob Dylan, there\'s some see-sawing. Take a look at the Tableau interactive for a closer look. [via Waxy ] Interactive: Common chord progressions in 1,300 songs March 21, 2013 to Network Visualization by Nathan Yau If you listen to the radio long enough, you\'ve probably noticed that many songs sound similar or remind of you of a song you\'ve heard before. Hooktheory shows you just how similar some songs are via chord progressions in over 1,300 songs . The small group analyzed the data last year and presented some static charts, but this interactive version takes it a step further. Simply start by selecting a chord in the network diagram. Songs that use that chord appear on the right. Then select another chord in the network diagram to find songs that use the chord progression from the original to the new. Keep selecting chords to filter further. So in the end, there are two main things you can do: (1) Find songs that use the same chord progression and (2) see the most likely chord given the current selection. My musical knowledge from middle school jazz band is long gone, but it\'s fun to explore, and you\'ll likely find relationships to songs that you didn\'t expect. [Thanks, Dave] A new brand of cartographer March 20, 2013 to Mapping by Nathan Yau Emily Underwood on new cartographers and the growing field : Geographers have traditionally studied how the natural environment contributes to human society and vice versa, whereas cartographers have focused more explicitly on the art and science of mapmaking. Over the past couple of decades, a new field has emerged: geographical information systems (GIS), blending the study and expression of geographic information. Cartography and geography have overlapped and spawned innumerable subspecialties and applications. Modern geographers and cartographers are involved in diverse projects: tracking fleets of vehicles or products, helping customers locate a Dunkin\' Donuts, modeling environmental scenarios such as oil spills, and studying the spread of disease. You could substitute visualization and statistics for cartography throughout, and it\'d almost all still be valid. The reoccurring theme is that although academic programs can be fine resources, most of your success has to do with what you can learn on your own, as data-related fields are changing fast. How to be Interesting by Jessica Hagy March 19, 2013 to Infographics by Nathan Yau Jessica Hagy, the one who made Venn diagrams on index cards popular, has a new book out today: How to be Interesting . You want to leave a mark, not a blemish. Be a hero, not a spectator. You want to be interesting. (Who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t?) But sometimes it takes a nudge, a wake-up call, an intervention!\xe2\x80\x94and a little help. This is where Jessica Hagy comes in. A writer and illustrator of great economy, charm, and insight, she\xe2\x80\x99s created How to Be Interesting , a uniquely inspirational how-to that combines fresh and pithy lessons with deceptively simple diagrams and charts. The book started from this , which could probably also stand in as a guide on how to enjoy life. Monitor your surroundings with these sensors March 19, 2013 to Self-surveillance by Nathan Yau It wasn\'t long ago that sensors and personal tracking seemed like pure nerdery . In the early stages of graduate school \xe2\x80\x94 before smartphones were popular or even widely available \xe2\x80\x94 I played around with sensors that had finicky battery life and Internet connectivity, the software was buggy, and the hardware looked clunky. New tracking devices pop up regularly these days. They\'re built and designed for a wider audience, and sometimes to my surprise, the devices are embraced by the target audience. It started with personal trackers that are fitness and health-related, but people are branching out now to monitoring their surroundings. Two showed up on my radar this past week: CubeSensors and Thermodo .

For her master\'s project, Thank the Academy, digital media student Rebecca Rolfe explored these patterns .

Continue Reading Other ways to follow FlowingData March 14, 2013 to Announcements by Nathan Yau With Google Reader closing its doors in July (which stinks because I use it multiple times per day), now is a good time to make a switch. For those who want to stick with RSS, you can grab the feed here . Note the change in feed URL. I used to use a service called Feedburner to deliver the RSS, but that\'s owned by Google, too, so it\'s probably best to move away from there. Then of course you can follow @flowingdata on Twitter . Or Facebook . Or Google+ . Or via daily or weekly email . Feltron 2012 Annual Report March 14, 2013 to Self-surveillance by Nathan Yau Today might be pi day, but yesterday was Feltron Report day. The theme this year is visual density \xe2\x80\x94 or maybe programmatic graphics. Either way, it looks mighty fine. Choosing the right seat March 13, 2013 to Infographics by Nathan Yau It can be tricky picking the right seat at a dinner party. So much depends on how many people there are and what shape the table is. Luckily, Alex Cornell provides a guide on where to sit and when to arrive to get the best seat of the night . The 4-person circle is your best bet. This is the ideal setup. You are safe sitting in any seat. Regardless how interesting everyone is, you pretty much can\xe2\x80\x99t go wrong. Note: as the diameter of the table increases, so too does the importance that you sit adjacent to someone you like. Sorry for always sitting at the lonely end seat in the 7-person rectangle. [via kottke ] Word tree for any URL or Twitter username March 12, 2013 to Network Visualization by Nathan Yau In 2007, Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Vi\xc3\xa9gas created the word tree , a search tool for unstructured text. You enter the text, pick a word or phrase, and you can see how other words and phrases branch from the root. Data visualization developer Jason Davies rephrased the visualization in JavaScript, and you can enter a URL or a Twitter username (or enter your own text like with the original). There\'s also a nice sidebar that makes it easier to browse through the text. So for example, the above is a word tree for The Cat in the Hat , and you can see what branches from Thing One and Thing Two. The phrase "and Thing Two" often follows "Thing One" as do exclamation points. The reverse feature comes in handy for text like Steve Jobs\' commencement speech . Data hackathon challenges and why questions are important March 12, 2013 to Statistics by Nathan Yau Jake Porway, executive director of DataKind on data hackathons and why they require careful planning to actually work : Any data scientist worth their salary will tell you that you should start with a question, NOT the data. Unfortunately, data hackathons often lack clear problem definitions. Most companies think that if you can just get hackers, pizza, and data together in a room, magic will happen. This is the same as if Habitat for Humanity gathered its volunteers around a pile of wood and said, "Have at it!" By the end of the day you\'d be left with a half of a sunroom with 14 outlets in it. Without subject matter experts available to articulate problems in advance, you get results like those from the Reinvent Green Hackathon. Reinvent Green was a city initiative in NYC aimed at having technologists improve sustainability in New York. Winners of this hackathon included an app to help cyclists "bikepool" together and a farmer\'s market inventory app. These apps are great on their own, but they don\'t solve the city\'s sustainability problems. They solve the participants\' problems because as a young affluent hacker, my problem isn\'t improving the city\'s recycling programs, it\'s finding kale on Saturdays. Without clear direction on what to do with the data or questions worth answering, hackathons can end up being a bust from all angles. From the organizer side, you end up with a hodgepodge of projects that vary a lot in quality and purpose. From the participant side, you\'re left up to your own devices and have to approach the data blind, without a clear starting point. From the judging side, you almost always end up having to pick a winner when there isn\'t a clear one, because the criteria of the contest was fuzzy to begin with. This also applies to hiring freelancers for visualization work. You should have a clear goal or story to tell with your data. If you expect the hire to analyze your data and produce a graphic, you better get someone with a statistics background. Otherwise, you end up with a design-heavy piece with little substance. Basically, the more specific you can be about what you\'re looking for, the better. Amiigo: The exercise tracker that identifies exercises March 11, 2013 to Self-surveillance by Nathan Yau Self-tracking devices are all the rage these days. I went to the Apple store, and there was practically a whole wall of them. They were all uni-taskers though. There was one for cycling, another for running, and one for golfing. Amiigo, an Indiegogo campaign with four days left to contribute (but funded to completion five times over as of this writing), aims to track multiple exercises and figure out what you\'re exercise you\'re doing automatically . Continue Reading What data brokers know about you March 11, 2013 to Statistics by Nathan Yau Lois Beckett for ProPublica has a thorough piece on data brokers \xe2\x80\x94 companies that collect and sell information about you \xe2\x80\x94 and what they know and where they get the data from. They start with the basics, like names, addresses and contact information, and add on demographics, like age, race, occupation and "education level," according to consumer data firm Acxiom\'s overview of its various categories. But that\'s just the beginning: The companies collect lists of people experiencing "life-event triggers" like getting married, buying a home, sending a kid to college \xe2\x80\x94 or even getting divorced. Credit reporting giant Experian has a separate marketing services division, which sells lists of "names of expectant parents and families with newborns" that are "updated weekly." The companies also collect data about your hobbies and many of the purchases you make. Want to buy a list of people who read romance novels? Epsilon can sell you that, as well as a list of people who donate to international aid charities. So if you\'re wondering why you received that catalog in the mail, it was probably because a store sold your purchase data to a broker.

The world as one city March 8, 2013 to Data Art by Nathan Yau When we build models of the world, we often think of it broken down into pieces, such as cities, counties, and countries. In their newly funded project The City of 7 Billion , architects Joyce Hsiang and Bimal Mendis aim to model the world as one city , to study the impact of population growth on the environment and natural resources on a larger scale. Every corner of the planet, they argue, is "urban" in some sense, touched by farming that feeds cities, pollution that comes out of them, industrialization that has made urban centers what they are today. So why not think of the world as a single urban entity? Hsiang and Mendis don\'t yet know exactly what this will look like (that is the question, Mendis says). But they are planning to seed their geo-spatial model with worldwide data on population growth, economic and social indicators, topography, ecology and more. Ultimately, they hope, other researchers will be able to use the open-source platform for research on development patterns or air quality; the public will be able to use it to grasp the implications of building in a flood plain or implementing an energy policy; and architects will be able to use it to view the world as if it were a single project site. Along with a slew of other challenges I am sure, one of the big ones is finding comparable data at high granularity. Large cities tend to track (and hopefully release) data about what\'s going, but once you step out of the major areas, data grows scarce. They started with population , which was transformed into the physical installation above. Using search data to find drug side effects March 8, 2013 to Statistics by Nathan Yau Along the same lines as Google Flu Trends, researchers at Microsoft, Stanford and Columbia University are investigating whether search data can be used to find interactions between drugs . They recently found an interaction. Using automated software tools to examine queries by six million Internet users taken from Web search logs in 2010, the researchers looked for searches relating to an antidepressant, paroxetine, and a cholesterol lowering drug, pravastatin. They were able to find evidence that the combination of the two drugs caused high blood sugar. The idea is that people are searching for symptoms and medications, and this data is stored in anonymized search logs. They then followed a suspicion that using the two drugs at the same time might cause hyperglycemia. Those that searched for the two drugs were more likely to search for hyperglycemia than the control group (probably those who didn\'t search for hyperglycemia). The work is still in its infancy, but it\'ll be interesting to see how this sort of data can be used to supplement existing work by the Food and Drug Administration.

Kristen Nicole 2007-05-02 16:58:02 UTC Contactify is a new service that will create a URL in leiu of your email address, so that you can safely display a way for people to contact you without having to disguise or reveal your email address. Creating a Contactify account is simple: input your email address and a password, type in the CAPTCHA, and you'll get to activate your account. Now you have a URL instead of an email address that can be posted on your website, personal blog, or social networking profile. When others click on your Contactify URL, they're redirected to a message page where they can type in a message and leave their email address. Contactify works to reduce spam by including a CAPTCHA for the sender as well. The message is then forwarded to your email address. Unlike Spambox, Contactify is not temporary and won't require an expiry date. Though, Spambox can be used to replace your email address in all situations, whereas Contactify is a URL and cannot be placed in an email field for things such as site registration. And unfortunately for Contactify, they sent us their release a day too late! They would have come in handy for all you readers requesting a Joost invite, but not wanting to leave an email address in the public comments thread.

Amsterdam is a huge city with several district articles containing sightseeing, restaurant, nightlife and accommodation listings \xe2\x80\x94 consider printing them all. Amsterdam at night Amsterdam [1] is the capital of the Netherlands . With more than one million inhabitants in its urban area, it is the country\'s largest city and its financial, cultural, and creative centre. Amsterdam is colloquially known as Venice of the North , because of its lovely canals that criss-cross the city, its impressive architecture and more than 1,500 bridges. There is something for every traveller\'s taste here, whether you prefer culture and history, serious partying, or just the relaxing charm of an old European city. [ edit ] Districts Districts of Amsterdam Old Centre The medieval centre and most visited area of Amsterdam. It is known for its traditional architecture, canals, shopping, and many coffeeshops. Dam Square is considered its ultimate centre, but just as interesting are the areas around Nieuwmarkt and Spui. The Red Light District is also a part of the Old Centre. Canal Ring A UNESCO World Heritage Site , the Canal Ring was dug in the 17th century to attract wealthy home owners. It is still a posh neighbourhood with many Dutch celebrities owning property. The Leidseplein and Rembrandtplein are the city\'s prime nightlife spots. Jordaan A traditional working class area gone upmarket with plenty of art galleries, hip boutiques and happening restaurants. Also includes the Haarlemmerbuurt and the Western Islands. Plantage Intended to be an extension of the Canal Ring, lack of demand made this into a leafy area with lots of greenery, botanical gardens and Artis Zoo. Also includes the Weesperbuurt and the Eastern Islands. South One of Amsterdam\'s prime areas, a trip to the city is not complete without a visit to the Museum Quarter. You can chill in the Vondelpark with a bottle of wine, or go hunt for bargains at the Albert Cuyp Market. It is the most popular area for accommodation as rates are considerably cheaper than in the city centre. West A vast suburban area that can be divided in Old and New West. The Old West is a charming area built in the late 19th century. The New West was built after World War II and often catches newspaper headlines for crime; urban renewal is underway to improve living conditions in this area. North The North is a newly-built suburb that lies at the northern side of the IJ. Most visitors go to the area east of the motorway A10, a protected polder area that culturally belongs to the Waterland and Zaan Region . This traditional Dutch countryside is best explored by bicycle. East The East is a large and diverse residential area. The Eastern Docklands and IJburg stand out as relatively affluent neighbourhoods known for their modern architecture. Bijlmer An exclave of Amsterdam, the Bijlmer was foreseen as a neighbourhood of the future with large apartment blocks separated by tracts of green. It turned into a lower-class residential district home to people of over 150 nationalities, often associated with crime and robberies. Its safety record has improved remarkably the last years, but it still is mostly visited by adventurous travellers (and football fans). [ edit ] Understand [ edit ] History Settled as a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became one of the most important trading centres in the world during the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century. The city\'s small mediaeval centre rapidly expanded as the Jordaan and the Canal Belt neighbourhoods were constructed; the latter\'s cultural significance was acknowledged when it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the city expanded in all directions, with many new neighbourhoods and suburbs designed in modernist styles. Amsterdam is not the seat of the government, which is in The Hague . It has always been a city that attracted many people from outside it\'s borders. Nowadays it\'s the city with the most different nationalities in the world (178 in 2010). The city has an informal atmosphere unlike other capital cities its size. In fact, Amsterdam has a history of non-conformism, tolerance and progressivism, all of which come together in its liberal policies concerning cannabis and prostitution. Other attractions include the Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh Museum, the Anne Frank House, the Flower Market, Albert Cuyp Market, and the Vondelpark. [ edit ] Orientation The "Amsterdam" that most visitors experience is the city centre, the semi-circle with Central Station at its apex. It corresponds to the city as it was around 1850. Six major concentric canals ring the Old Centre ; the Singel, the Herengracht, the Keizersgracht, the Prinsengracht, the Lijnbaansgracht, and the Singelgracht, together forming the Canal Ring . Other districts inside the city centre are the Jordaan , a former working-class area gone upmarket, and Plantage , a leafy and spacious area known for its zoo and botanical gardens. The roads Nassaukade, Stadhouderskade, and Mauritskade surround the centre and mark the location of the former city moat and fortifications. Almost everything outside this line was built after 1870. The semi-circle is on the south side of the IJ , originally the estuary of the Amstel to the Zuiderzee (South sea), nowadays canalised. Going east from Central Station, the railway passes the artificial islands of the redeveloped Eastern Docklands . North of the IJ is mainly housing, although a major dockland redevelopment has started there too. The river Amstel flows into the city from the south. Originally, it flowed along the line Rokin-Damrak. The dam in the Amstel , which gives the city its name, was located under the present Bijenkorf department store. The original settlement was on the right bank of the Amstel, on the present Warmoesstraat: it is therefore the oldest street in the city. The city has expanded in all directions, except to the northeast of the ring motorway. That area is a protected rural landscape of open fields and small villages that could be considered a part of the Waterland region. The radius of the semi-circle is about 2 km. All major tourist destinations, and most hotels, are located inside it or just outside it. As a result, a large swathe of Amsterdam is never visited by tourists: at least 90% of the population lives outside this area. Most economic activity in Amsterdam \xe2\x80\x94 the offices of the financial sector, and the port \xe2\x80\x94 is near or outside the ring motorway, which is 4-5 km from the centre. The expansion of Amsterdam outside this beltway, and the expansion of activity outside the old centre, is redefining what locals consider the \'central area\' of Amsterdam. Without a doubt the most popular district outside of the city centre is the South for its quality museums and gentrified neighbourhood \'De Pijp\'. [ edit ] Attitudes Many people choose to visit Amsterdam because of its reputation for tolerance, although part of this reputation is attributable to cultural misunderstandings. Prostitution is legalised and licensed in the Netherlands, and in Amsterdam it is very visible (window prostitution), and there are large numbers of prostitutes. The sale, possession, and consumption of small quantities of cannabis, while technically illegal, is tolerated by authorities (the policy of gedogen ). This does not mean that you can get away with anything in Amsterdam. In any case, public attitudes and official policy have hardened in recent years. For more on coffeeshops and drugs, see below in Stay safe . Depending on your viewpoint some people will consider Amsterdam an unwholesome city whereas other people will find their relaxed attitudes refreshing. If you avoid the red light district, Amsterdam is an excellent family destination. According to a Eurobarometer report in 2012, 90% of the population speak English as a second language.

However, in winter the days are short (8 hours daylight around Christmas), and the weather may be too cold to walk around the city comfortably, let alone cycle. January and February are the coldest months, with lows around -1\xc2\xb0C and highs around 5\xc2\xb0C. July and August are the warmest months, with an average temperature of 22\xc2\xb0C (72\xc2\xb0F). Some things are seasonal: the tulip fields flower only in the spring, and Queen\'s Day ( Koninginnedag ) is always on 30 April, unless it falls on a Sunday. Queen Beatrix was actually born on 31 January, but since January is very cold, the celebrations are held on the day she became the queen of the Netherlands, which is also the birthday of her mother, Juliana. [ edit ] Get in [ edit ] By plane Amsterdam Airport Schiphol ( IATA : AMS ) ( ICAO : EHAM ) [2] is one of the busiest airports in the world, situated 15 km south-west of the city. The national carrier for the Netherlands is KLM [3] , now merged with Air France. With partner Delta Air Lines [4] they offer worldwide connections. The US, Asia and Europe are particularly well served at Schiphol. British Airways offer up to 15 flights per day to 3 London Airports; Heathrow, Gatwick and London City. Transavia [5] , Jet2.com [6] , Easyjet [7] , and other low-cost carriers serve Schiphol, providing a fairly economical way to city-hop to Amsterdam from other spots in Europe . When leaving Amsterdam, give yourself enough time to get to your plane and through security (especially when flying to the United States)! Schiphol is a large airport \xe2\x80\x94 be there at least 2 hrs in advance. If you have time to kill, drop into the Rijksmuseum\'s Schiphol branch, between E and F Pier (non-Schengen area airside), which is free and open 07:00-20:00 daily. Coin-operated storage lockers are located along the main hallway through the transit/departure area, across from the start of the E wing. From \xe2\x82\xac6 per 24 hr, maximum one week. [8] There are plenty of fast-food chains and restaurants at the airport. It even has the busiest Burger King in the world with 1.3 million visitors a year. It has never closed since its opening in 1993. McDonald\'s [9] has three branches in and around the airport. [ edit ] Schiphol by train From Schiphol there is a direct train [10] to Amsterdam Central Station, for \xe2\x82\xac3.90 (or \xe2\x82\xac7.80 for same-day return), in 20 min. Buy the ticket from the machine (yellow with blue writing, pictured here ); if you purchase your ticket at the counter you will pay \xe2\x82\xac0.50 extra. Not all machines accept credit or debit cards. Don\'t buy the comfort class ticket, buy an single ticket with \'NS only\'. This ticket is valid on Sprinter, Intercity and night trains to Amsterdam - but not on Thalys or Fyra trains. The train station at Schiphol is located underground, under the main airport hall; trains to Amsterdam Central Station usually run from platform 3. Keep in mind that there are two seperate railwaylines to Amsterdam; one goes to Amsterdam Centraal station and the other goes to Amsterdam Zuid (Amsterdam South). There will be a lighted sign boad on the yellow train. The train for Ceantraal will say either: AMSTERDAM CENTRAAL or AMSTERDAM CS. These lines are not connected with eacho ther so check if the train you board goes to the Amsterdam you want. There are 4 to 5 trains per hour between Schiphol and Amsterdam in peak times. Trains run all night, although between 1am and 5am only once an hour during week days. The airport is connected with Amsterdam twice an hour in weekends (Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights). The price and duration of the journey are the same as during the day. Watch out for pick-pockets and baggage thieves: a common trick is a knock on your window to distract you, so that an accomplice can steal your luggage or laptop. Another one is to have an accomplice jam the doors and then steal your luggage. The thief jumps out and the door immediately closes, making it impossible to catch them. However, in recent years, railway police have made a great effort to reduce this sort of crime; nowadays it is at \'normal\', big-city like levels. [ edit ] Schiphol by local transport If you are desperately trying to save money or are staying near Leidseplein, you could use local transport from Schiphol to central Amsterdam. A trip takes about 30 min and leads directly to the south-west of the centre of Amsterdam (namely Museumplein and Leidseplein). Take local bus 197 which costs you \xe2\x82\xac2.38 to Leidseplein using the OV-chipkaart (see below ), or \xe2\x82\xac4.00 on board. Bus 197 currently runs every 15 min for most of the day, daily from 5:01AM till midnight. From midnight till 5AM, night buses run to and from the airport. If you don\'t want to change buses, take night bus N97 for \xe2\x82\xac4. This bus runs once an hour. [ edit ] Schiphol by taxi Do not use a taxi unless there is no alternative; travel to Schiphol by train or by bus, if possible. Taxis from Schiphol are expensive and priced unexpectedly. You pay a start rate of \xe2\x82\xac 2.65 plus \xe2\x82\xac 1.95 per km and \xe2\x82\xac 0.32 per minute. (dec 2012) The ride costs about \xe2\x82\xac40-50 to go to, say, the Leidseplein. Depending on the time of day and traffic levels, it could take only 25 min. If you\'re unlucky, it could take twice as long. Choose the nicest cab as that driver is more likely to be reputable. You don\'t have to pick the first taxi in line. If possible, reserve a taxi schiphol up-front [11] , this will ensure a lower and fixed price for the ride. [ edit ] Schiphol, other modes of transport The Connexxion Hotel Shuttle [12] serves over 100 city centre hotels, with 8-seater shared van departures about every 30 minutes between 6 AM and 9 PM, cost to most city centre destinations \xe2\x82\xac15.50/25.00 one-way/return -- more convenient than the train if you have heavy luggage and still cheaper than a taxi. Buses depart from platform A7 and can be reserved for the trip back \xe2\x98\x8e +31 38 3394741. If you plan to rent a car for the duration of your stay, Schiphol has several car rental companies on site [13] . Typical opening hours are 6AM-11PM daily. The car rental desk can be found in Schiphol Plaza, on the same level as the arrival halls. The A4 motorway leads straight from Schiphol to the Amsterdam ring road A10, in about 10 min. If you decided to bring your bicycle on the plane with you, there is a 15-kilometer sign-posted bike route from the airport to Amsterdam. Turn right as you leave the airport terminal: the cycle path starts about 200 metres down the road. There is a map of the cycle paths around Schiphol available on this PDF (green lines are cycle paths). [ edit ] Other airports Using airports other than Schiphol could prove cheaper in some cases, as some budget airlines fly to Eindhoven and Rotterdam Airports. Then buses and trains can be used to get to Amsterdam. Renting a car is also an option. A taxi is not advisable, from Rotterdam to Amsterdam a taxi would cost \xe2\x82\xac130, and from Eindhoven even more. From Eindhoven Airport ( IATA : EIN , ICAO : EHEH ) [14] take a local bus (Hermes bus 401, duration about 25 minutes, frequency about four times per hour, \xe2\x82\xac3.20 on board or \xe2\x82\xac1.71 using an OV-chipkaart ) to the train station, from there take a train to Amsterdam (duration 1hr 20 min, frequency four times per hour, single \xe2\x82\xac17.20). Alternatively, take the express bus directly from the airport to Amsterdam central station, which takes 2 hr 15 min. This service goes only 3 to 4 times per day; see their website for a schedule. The ticket price is \xe2\x82\xac25.50 for a single or \xe2\x82\xac42.50 for a return [15] . From Rotterdam The Hague Airport ( IATA : RTM , ICAO : EHRD ) [16] (" Zestienhoven ") take a city bus (RET "airport shuttle" bus 33, duration 25-30 minutes, frequency every 10-20 minutes, \xe2\x82\xac2.50 on board or \xe2\x82\xac1.39 using the OV-chipkaart ) to Rotterdam Centraal train station, from there take a train to Amsterdam (duration about an hour, frequency every 10-20 minutes, single \xe2\x82\xac13.40). Schiphol airport is 11 km from the centre of Amsterdam in a straight line, Rotterdam is 57 km and Eindhoven is 107 km. Other airports that could possibly be used are: Groningen Airport Eelde (142 km) ( IATA : GRQ ) [17] Maastricht Aachen Airport (173 km) ( IATA : MST ) [18] Weeze Airport in Germany (121 km) ( IATA : NRN ) [19] Antwerp International Airport in Belgium (135 km) ( IATA : ANR ) [20] Brussels Airport in Belgium (167 km) ( IATA : BRU ) [21] [ edit ] By train Sign for Platform 2b at Amsterdam Railway Station Train stations in Amsterdam (in orange; centre in bright orange). Black lines: railways. Red lines: metro lines. Most trains arrive and depart from Amsterdam Centraal Station (with one extra \'a\' in Dutch), located on an island between the Amsterdam/Old Centre and the IJ waterfront. Other important train stations are Duivendrecht and Bijlmer-ArenA in the southeast, Amstel and Muiderpoort in the East , RAI and Zuid-WTC in the South , and Lelylaan and Sloterdijk in the West . Schiphol Airport also has its own train station, which functions as a major interchange station. It has at least seven trains an hour to Amsterdam Centraal, with additional trains going to other stations in Amsterdam. Most international trains run directly to Amsterdam Centraal Station : Thalys [22] is a high-speed train that connects Amsterdam with Paris (3h19), Brussels (1h54), and Antwerp (1h12). Thalys trains rup up to ten times a day. The cheapest tickets are sold out early, so book in advance if possible. There is a bar coach available where food, drinks and public transport tickets are sold. When travelling in first class, a meal and all drinks are included in the train fare. The Fyra [23] is a high-speed train that connects Amsterdam with Brussels (1h57) and Antwerp (1h22). Until May 1, a jump-on ticket is sold at the Ticket & Service counter at Amsterdam Central Station, without requiring a prior reservation. Tickets with reservations are also sold online. There is a refreshment trolley on board of each train for drinks and snacks. ICE International [24] connects Amsterdam up 7 times each day with D\xc3\xbcsseldorf (2h16), Cologne (2h41), and Frankfurt (3h46). One ICE-train runs to Basel (6h43). There is a BordBistro-coach available on each ICE-train. The Intercity train to Berlin [25] runs every two hours and connects Amsterdam Central Station with Osnabr\xc3\xbcck (3h08), Hanover (4h20), and Berlin (6h22). A BordBistro-coach is available on each train to Berlin. CityNightLine/Euronight [26] runs overnight trains from Amsterdam Centraal Station directly to Copenhagen (1 night), Warsaw (1 night), Minsk (1 night and 1 day), Moscow (2 nights and 1 day), Prague (1 night), Munich (1 night) and Zurich (1 night). Travelling with these trains might save you a hotel night. You can choose to spend the night in ordinary seats, reclining seats (only to Warsaw/Munich/Z\xc3\xbcrich), 6- or 4-bedded couchettes, or a 3, 2 or 1-bedded private sleeper-compartment with washing bassin or private shower/toilet. A breakfast is included in the sleeper-compartment, other snacks/drinks are also on sale onboard the trains. Eurostar [27] runs a high speed service from London St Pancras Station to Brussels Zuid/Midi Station. From Brussels you can continue to Amsterdam by Thalys or Fyra . Tickets are sold on the Eurostar website and (sometimes cheaper) on the NS Hispeed website. If you plan to take a train to Amsterdam, it\'s advisable to check the train times in the international journey planner [28] . Most tickets are sold online, and often it is cheaper to book tickets in advance. Tickets are also sold at the international ticket offices at Amsterdam Centraal Station and at Schiphol Airport. Or visit the Treinreiswinkel [29] (Singel 393). [ edit ] By bus Most international bus services are affiliated to Eurolines [30] , which has a terminal at Amstel Station (train station, metro station 51, 53, 54, tram 12). One bus per day is usually the maximum frequency on these routes. The British low-budget bus company Megabus [31] operates bus services twice-daily from both London and Paris to Amsterdam via Brussels , terminating at the Zeeburg Park and Ride Coach Park/Zuiderzeeweg tram stop in the east of the city. From there, there are frequent tram and bus services into the city, although the driver will usually advise you to take a tram. There are other international bus services, but they are often aimed at very specific markets, e.g. Polish migrant workers. There are almost no long-distance internal bus services in the Netherlands, and none to Amsterdam. [ edit ] By car The western part of the Netherlands has a dense (and congested) road network. Coming from the east (Germany), the A1 motorway leads directly to Amsterdam. On the A12 from Arnhem, change at Utrecht to the A2 northbound. From the south (Belgium), the A2 goes directly to Amsterdam: the A16 /A27 from Antwerp via Breda connects to the A2 south of Utrecht. From The Hague , the A4 leads to Amsterdam. All motorways to Amsterdam connect to the ring motorway, the A10. From this motorway, main roads lead radially into Amsterdam (the roads S101 through S118). In most cases, you should want to avoid going to the city centre by car: traffic is dense and parking spaces are expensive and nearly impossible to find. Instead, when on the A10, follow the signs to one of the P+R -spots (P+R Zeeburg to the east, P+R ArenA to the southeast, P+R Olympisch Stadion to the south, and P+R Sloterdijk to the west). Here you can park your car and take public transport to the city centre, for a single fare. There is only a flat rate of \xe2\x82\xac8 a day, but public transport to the city centre for up to 5 persons is included. There are also a few places a short walk from outer tram stops to park for free. The speed limit on Dutch motorways is 120 km/h, except where indicated. On the A10 ring motorway around Amsterdam, the maximum speed is 100 km/h, and 80 km/h on the Western section. These limits are strictly enforced and there are many speed cameras. [ edit ] By sea The maritime Passenger Terminal Amsterdam is close to the city centre but is only for cruise ships. The nearest ferry port is IJmuiden which is served by DFDS Seaways , who offer a daily overnight ferry services from Newcastle-upon-Tyne (North Shields) in the United Kingdom see [32] (official site). 125 km away by car there is a ferry terminal at Rotterdam Europoort (ferry from Kingston Upon Hull ), and Hook of Holland (ferry from Harwich ). Hook of Holland has a train station. Take the train to Schiedam Centrum or Rotterdam Centraal and from there a train to Amsterdam. [ edit ] Get around Amsterdam\'s centre is fairly small, and almost abnormally flat, so you can easily get to most tourist destinations on foot - from the train station, within half an hour. [ edit ] By public transit A new national ticketing system has recently been introduced, based on a contactless card, called OV-chipkaart ("Public Transport chip card"). Since 3 June 2010, the old \'strippenkaart\' system has been abandoned on all forms of public transport in Amsterdam, making the chipkaart the only valid way of travelling in Amsterdam. To travel with a card, one has to check in at the start of the journey and check out at the end by holding the card in front of the card reader. Three types of OV-chipkaart are available: a personal card on which you can load weekly/monthly/yearly subscriptions an anonymous card on which you can load money which can be spent on public transport a disposable card which can be used for a limited number of hours/trips only The first two types carry a fee of \xe2\x82\xac7.50 for the card itself, and you have to have at least \xe2\x82\xac4 on it to be able to travel. The OV-chipkaart can be obtained from GVB vending machines in all metro stations, from the desks at some bigger stations (including Centraal Station) and some shops (see this map ). For visitors, the most useful type of travel pass is probably the 1/24/48/72/96/120/144/168 hour ticket, issued as a disposable OV-card without extra cost. This allows the holder to travel on an unlimited number of journeys on tram, metro and night bus services throughout the validity period of the pass. On a tram, only the 1 and 24 hr tickets can be purchased on board. These passes are also available at tourist offices (located at Schiphol airport and just outside Centraal Station), AKO bookstores in Schiphol Airport and Centraal Station, many hotels and GVB Tickets & Info. Day passes are not valid on buses operated by Connexxion and Arriva. Prices as of Jan 2012: \xe2\x82\xac7.50/24 hours, \xe2\x82\xac12/48 hours, \xe2\x82\xac16/72 hours, \xe2\x82\xac20.50/96 hours, \xe2\x82\xac25/120 hours, \xe2\x82\xac28.50/144 hours and \xe2\x82\xac31/168 hours. If you stay longer in Amsterdam, you can buy discounted weekly or monthly tickets from most post offices or other ticket sale points which are cheaper. GVB tickets are not valid on trains to Schiphol airport. You can use them on buses to Schiphol but it\'s usually quicker to get there by train. For current information on the Dutch Public Transportation-system (\'Openbaar Vervoer\' or O.V. in Dutch/NL) check online Openbaar Vervoer (O.V.) . [ edit ] Tram Public transport within the city is operated by the GVB (Gemeentevervoerbedrijf [33] ). The tram (16 lines) is the main form of public transport system in the central area, and there are also dozens of night bus routes which run in place of the trams between midnight and 5am. All tram stops have a detailed map of the system and the surrounding area. You can also get a free public transport map at the GVB Tickets & Info offices (just outside Centraal Station) or in the tram. Most trams have conductors, near the rear of the tram. Board (and obtain tickets if necessary) by the driver or the conductor. If you have questions, the conductor or driver will be sure to respond to your query. Remember that you can only buy 1 hr and 24 hr tickets on board the tram. When boarding and alighting a tram, you must check in and out by placing your ticket/OV-chipkaart on one of the abundant round-shaped readers, even if you have just bought a ticket on board. All trams have pre-recorded audio announcements indicating the next stop, with most also having visual indication. All announcements on board are in Dutch, however some announcements (such as those indicating termini and important stops (such as Dam Square) and reminders to check out when alighting the tram) are also in English. [ edit ] Metro Amsterdam Metro/Sneltram Map There is a four line metro , including a short underground section in the city centre, that serves the neighbourhoods of the South East. It takes 15-20 min from Centraal Station or Waterlooplein to the Bijlmer (Amsterdam Arena stadium, Heineken Music Hall and Pathe Arena cinema and IMAX). A fifth metro line, the north/south line, is currently under construction and is due to be opened in 2017. This big project started in 2003 to build a new underground metro line to connect the north of Amsterdam with the south (the Noord/Zuidlijn or North/Southline). The project has proved somewhat of a disaster for the city government with big budget overruns and delays. Building in the wet underground of Amsterdam is difficult and some buildings along the line have sustained damage due to subsidence. For the visitor to Amsterdam, the only thing to note are the ongoing roadworks along the route of the metro line. Underground metro stations are still being built or finished often causing parts of roads to be blocked off to cars, buses and trams for an extended time. Usually you can pass on foot or bicycle. [ edit ] Bus Just like the tram and metro, local buses are operated by the GVB. There are also suburban buses to nearby towns such as Haarlem and Uithoorn; these are operated by Connexxion or EBS (the company name and house style is prominent on the bus side) and can be used within Amsterdam if you travel with an OV-chipkaart. Disposable cards are not valid on the buses except the night buses. [ edit ] By boat There are several free ferry services across the IJ river, to Amsterdam North, the most frequent runs every 7 min. They all leave from a new jetty on the northern (rear) side of Centraal Station. The nicest one is the 15 min service to NDSM Werf, a funky up and coming industrial neighbourhood with a nice cafe-bar (IJkantine), restaurant (Noorderlicht) and indoor skate\n\n'

Asia From Wikitravel Jump to: navigation , search Contents Regions Cities Other destinations Understand Get in Get around Talk [+] See Itineraries Do Buy Eat Drink Sleep [+] Stay safe Crime Stay healthy Contact Asia is too massive and diverse to conceptualize as a single digestible travel "destination". Even defining the borders of this continent is difficult - from the mountains around the Black Sea in the west, to the snow fields of Siberia in the east, there are more people and cities in Asia than outside of it. Band-e Haibat Lake in Afghanistan Asia\'s and the world\'s highest point is Mount Everest, along the border of Tibet (China) and Nepal, which rises to 8,848\xc2\xa0m (29,028\xc2\xa0feet) above sea level. Its lowest point is the Dead Sea , located at the meeting points of Israel, the Palestinian Territories, and Jordan, whose surface is 400\xc2\xa0m (1,312\xc2\xa0feet) below sea level. Asia\'s longest river is the Yangtze, which runs 6,300\xc2\xa0km (3,915\xc2\xa0miles) through China, from all the way from the high Tibetan Plateau to Shanghai. Its largest lake is the 386,400\xc2\xa0sq\xc2\xa0km (149,200\xc2\xa0square\xc2\xa0mile) Caspian Sea, which is surrounded by several Central Asian nations. Asia is bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the east, by Australia to the south east, and by the Indian Ocean to the south. It is bordered by the Red Sea to the south west, by Europe and Urals to the west, and by the Arctic Ocean to the north. Travel options range widely, from the desert ruins and modern mega-malls of the Middle East to the magnificent ancient monuments in South Asia , and from the beach bungalows and jungle treks of South-East Asia to the mega-cities and technology capitals of East Asia . Find out more about regions, destinations, and itineraries below. Asia offers very diverse travel options. There are ultra modern, largely democratic countries like Japan and the East Asian Tigers of Singapore , Hong Kong , Taiwan and South Korea which are very prosperous and in which people enjoy very high standards of living. On the other hand, Afghanistan , Laos and East Timor are extremely poor countries where people struggle even to get a few grains of rice each day. Of course, there are also many countries lying somewhere in the middle, such as the emerging powerhouses of China and India which make wonderful travel destinations in themselves due to their long history, size and diversity. Thailand is a magnet for travellers, with great food, a tropical climate, fascinating culture and great beaches. Asia also contains North Korea , suffering under one of, if not the most, oppressive regimes in the world and, therefore, very safe for travellers.

For the Middle East, Dubai is by far the largest hub, with Doha and Abu Dhabi also having reasonably good connections. If you are coming to Asia by train, you\'ll be likely coming in through Russia or Turkey, although other options may exist. For an interesting experience, try the Trans-Siberian Railway . The entrance to the Forbidden City, Beijing [ edit ] Get around Due to the vast distances and expanses of water separating Asia\'s different regions, air travel is likely to be the preferred mode of transport between the regions\' many travel destinations. Fares are lower on average than in Europe or America, and low cost airlines in Asia are rapidly expanding their networks particularly in Southeast Asia. [ edit ] Talk Many languages are spoken throughout Asia, comprising a number of families and some unrelated isolates. While the local languages are always best, some blanket languages can be useful in multiple countries. In the Middle East , Arabic is widely understood, while knowledge of Russian will help you in Central Asia and the Caucasus . Hindi / Urdu is useful in South Asia and Malay / Indonesian will help you in Southeast Asia .

[ edit ][ add listing ] Drink Usually the largest city or capital has the best clubs. [ edit ][ add listing ] Sleep [ edit ] Stay safe Safety in Asia can vary wildly, but it is a safe place in general. Nearly all tourist attractions on the continent are far from conflict, but there are a few regions in which conflict and/or general lawlessness exists. The most obvious examples are Afghanistan and Iraq . Afghanistan is under foreign occupation, and both countries are in a state of war against insurgent groups such as the Taliban, Al Qaeda, and various other armed forces. These countries are considered no-go areas and should be completely avoided by travellers (if one absolutely must go, consult War zone safety and the authorities of your country before you go). Yemen could also be added to the list of no-go countries, due to a very high threat of terrorist attacks, kidnappings, tribal violence and general lawlessness. Since January 2011, Syria also should not be visited due to civil unrest, including some indiscriminate attacks on or in cities and checkpoints. Other countries in Asia generally can be visited, though some countries have regions and areas that should be avoided. The Middle East is generally known for its political tensions, and while true for some part, most of the region can be visited without any major risks. The Gaza Strip is effectively a war zone between Palestinian factions and the Israeli army, where kidnappings of foreigners have occurred. Israel has coped with missile attacks as well as suicide bombings by Islamic militant groups, such as Hamas and Hezbollah. Lebanon and the West Bank (Palestinian National Authority) generally cope with an unstable political situation and internal conflict. Some regions of the Caucasus are considered dangerous due to active insurgent groups, particularly the North Caucasus ( Chechnya ), Abkhazia and South Ossetia . Bahrain has experienced some political violence, too, so check on current conditions before you go. Iran and Pakistan cope with a low-level conflict in the Balochistan region against Baloch insurgents. More dangerously, Pakistan is active in a full-scale war in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas , both of which should not be visited. Kashmir , claimed by both Pakistan and India, is also a region with tens of thousands of casualties since 1989 due to political strife and insurgency. In 2009, the Naxalite-Maoist insurgency in India has resurfaced, particularly in Chhattisgarh and other parts of Eastern India . Northeastern India also copes with dozens of insurgent groups, some of which have armed factions. Southeast Asia is a major travel region and most of it is perfectly safe to visit. A notable exception is East Timor , which continues to face sporadic internal ethnic and political tension and related violence may occur. But even in some popular countries, there are some areas that should be avoided. The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao in the south of the Philippines is an area of conflict with several Muslim and communist rebel groups fighting with the Philippine army. It was declared the world\'s most hazardous area for journalists in 2009 by the Committee to Protect Journalists. 18 reporters died in a massacre in Maguindanao that claimed the lives of almost 60 people. The rest of the country, specifically Luzon and the Visayas , are safe, just like the rest of Mindanao (including Davao and Cagayan de Oro areas). Thailand , the most visited country in Southeast Asia, is perfectly safe, with the notable exception of four deep southern provinces , where fighting between the Thai military and Islamic insurgent groups still continues to this day. Indonesia is a very diverse country, with armed groups fighting for independence in Papua . Maluku is relatively safe now, but has seen periodic eruptions of violence occur in 1999-2003. Indonesia also copes with Islamic extremist groups throughout the country. Bali , the most popular tourist destination of the country, dealt with Islamic terrorist attacks in Kuta in 2002 and 2005. The island can be visited, but avoiding large gatherings and crowded nightclubs could be advised. East Asia is probably the safest area in the continent, but political tensions also exist in this region. You might want to avoid the border between North Korea and South Korea as these two countries are technically still at war with each other. China , a vast and diverse country, is surprisingly safe for its size, yet the restive provinces of Tibet (and its accompanying counties and prefectures in neighbouring provinces) and Xinjiang are often restricted to foreign travellers at any hint of trouble. [ edit ] Crime Refer to the specific country pages and the authorities of your country for more information. [ edit ] Stay healthy Many areas of Asia, especially Southeast Asia and South Asia, are humid tropical, and there are certain health risks attached to travel in those regions -- such as dengue fever and risk of malaria. Consult the country articles for specific information. [ edit ] Contact This article is an outline and needs more content. It has a template , but there is not enough information present.

They\'ve long been known as a resort vacation destination for honeymooners and retirees, but a small movement toward eco-tourism and backpacking has started to open up the Caribbean to more independent travel. With year-round good weather (with the occasional but sometimes serious exception of hurricane season in the late summer and early fall), promotional air fares from Europe and North America, and hundreds of islands to explore, the Caribbean offers something for almost everyone. [ edit ] Understand The Caribbean islands were first inhabited by the Arawak Indians, then were invaded by a more aggressive tribe, the Caribs. Unfortunately, neither could appreciate their victory forever, although the Arawaks may have had a quiet reign of nearly two millenia. Then the Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, French, Danish, and British arrived, after which the Carib population steeply declined due to various factors. The islands have known many historic battles and more than a few pirate stories. [ edit ] Regions Cuba , Dominican Republic , Haiti , Jamaica , Puerto Rico and the Cayman Islands , often grouped as Greater Antilles , are by far the largest countries in the area and the most visited by travellers. In the north is the Lucayan Archipelago , which includes The Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands . The Caribbean also includes the Lesser Antilles , a group of much smaller islands to the east. Further to the west and south, there are various less frequently visited islands that belong to Central and South American countries.

Central America From Wikitravel North America : Central America Jump to: navigation , search Contents Countries Cities Other destinations Understand Talk [+] Get in By plane By bus Get around See Buy Eat Drink Stay safe Stay healthy Get out Central America is the thin section of land that links the North American continent with the South American continent. Geographically part of North America, it is made up of seven small, mostly tropical countries that have much more in common with South America and Mexico than the more affluent north. Mexico is occasionally considered part of Central America due to the language and cultural heritage it shares with several of the countries in the region. [ edit ] Countries Belize Costa Rica El Salvador Guatemala Honduras Nicaragua Panama [ edit ] Cities Antigua Guatemala Belize City Guatemala City Managua Panama City San Jos\xc3\xa9 San Pedro Sula San Salvador Tegucigalpa [ edit ] Other destinations Cocos Island National Park Coiba National Marine Park Cop\xc3\xa1n Ruinas Corcovado National Park Arenal Volcano Isla Ometepe Mesoamerican Barrier Reef R\xc3\xado Pl\xc3\xa1tano Biosphere Reserve Tikal [ edit ] Understand Until the 1990s, the region, (apart from peaceful Honduras, Belize and Costa Rica), was subject to brutal repression ( Guatemala ), civil wars ( El Salvador and Nicaragua ), and proxy wars between opposite parties supported either by the US or the Soviet Union. This dark political and social situation changed with the end of the Cold War and after the signing of peace agreements at the beginning of the 1990s. Now the region is living a process of change and reforms that will hopefully allow travelers to discover an interesting and relatively cheap travel destination. Generally, the people of Central America are kind and warm, and welcoming to foreigners. There is a diversity of culture from one end of Central America to the other, and indigenous culture plays an important role in the region, especially in Guatemala , El Salvador and Honduras . [ edit ] Talk Due to the extensive Spanish colonial presence in the region, American dialects of Spanish are the primary language, especially of the government and in the cities. (English is the official language of Belize , a former UK colony, but you will still find yourself speaking a lot of Spanish in the country.) Native languages are still spoken in many rural areas. However, English is co-official in Nicaragua\'s Caribbean coast, along with indigenous languages. English speaking people can be found on the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Panama. [ edit ] Get in People from industrialized countries should have no problem in crossing borders and might expect a border fee from around $2-$20 depending on country. When crossing the border, no one will flag you down to get your stamp. You will need to find the immigration office on your own and get your stamp. A visa ahead of time is usually not required [ edit ] By plane Regular cheap flights are available from the United States to Central Americas airports. Very regular buses run from Chetumal in Mexico to the town of Corozal in Belize, a journey lasting one hour and costing around $4 US. You may have to pay an exit tax, or a fee to validate your Mexican visa for multiple entries when you leave Mexico, and there is also an exit tax when you leave Belize.Juan Santamar\xc3\xada airport in Costa Rica also gets flights, from Europe (Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Madrid; US (Miami, Los Angeles, Dallas, New York City, Houston, Phoenix, Charlotte, Orlando, etc). Agusto C. Sandino International Airport in Nicaragua and Comalapa Airport in El Salvador also have many destinations. Because flights directly to Central America from outside the Western Hemisphere are very expensive, it is often cheaper to fly via the U.S. For example, a flight Sydney->Mexico City costs about $2500. If you fly with Jetstar [1] to Hawaii , then with Hawaiian Airlines [2] to LA , and afterwards by bus (or plane) to Mexico City, it will cost less than $1000. [ edit ] By bus It is actually much easier to bus from the United States to Central America than most imagine. It is a distance of about 1000 miles from the US border at Brownsville to the Guatemalan/Mexican border. The trip can be done in one full day (strongly not recommended), instead the wise traveller would take his time and enjoy the many interesting sites along the way such as Real de Catorce , Veracruz , Xalapa , San Cristobal de las Casas , Palenque etc. Bus fare from Brownsville to the Guate border runs about $130 USD currently (Jan 08). From the Guatemalan Border, one can take a bus like the Tica Bus to get to Panama or any of the CA-4 countries for around 130 USD or less. There are no roads leading to Colombia from Central America. [ edit ] Get around If you have money to burn or in a tight shift, TACA and COPA offers good connections throughout the region but its relatively expensive due to the lack of competition. The international travel route leads mostly on the Pacific (west) side of central america. It basically starts south in Panama City , crosses on the Pacific site into Costa Rica , passes by San Jos\xc3\xa9 , crosses again at the Pacific coast into Nicaragua . It is possible to cross the Costa Rican / Panaman border at the Caribbean coast but it takes longer and the border is just open during the day. Between Costa Rica and Nicaragua are two official borders. The more frequented one is "Pe\xc3\xb1as Blancas" at the Pacific side and the other one is between Los Chiles and San Carlos, Nicaragua . Between Nicaragua and Honduras exist three border-crossings. Honduras and El Salvador share various border-crossings as well as Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador . Tica Bus [3] connects all of the Central American countries except Belize. [ edit ][ add listing ] See The Cloud Forest of Cusuco National Park in Honduras . A biodiversity hot spot visited by Operation Wallacea scientific expeditions. The Cloud Forests of Panama in Boquete . Many hotels are actually within the cloud forest; or you can take a tour high in to the mountains, through the clouds. Lake Atitlan in Guatemala . One of the most beautiful spots on the planet. A volcanic lake with three volcanoes around it. Colonial Towns, such as Antigua Guatemala , Quetzaltenango , ( Guatemala ); Juayua , Suchitoto in El Salvador , Gracias and Comayagua ( Honduras ), Le\xc3\xb3n and Granada in Nicaragua (the oldest colonial city in Nicaragua) or Panama City , San Blas Islands -Casco Viejo- ( Panama , where the Panama Canal can be visited as well). Ancient Mayan ruins in Belize , Honduras , Guatemala , and El Salvador . Amazing beaches in Tela,Trujillo, la Ceiba and the Bay Islands (Honduras) the Guanacaste, Puntarenas, and Lim\xc3\xb3n (Costa Rica); Montelimar, San Juan del Sur, Bahia Majagual, La Flor and Pochomil (Nicaragua); Bocas del Toro and El Farall\xc3\xb3n (Panama). Surf, especially in Honduras , Nicaragua , Costa Rica , and El Salvador . National Natural Parks, especially in El Salvador , Costa Rica , Panama and Nicaragua which has the 2nd largest rainforest in the Western Hemisphere, after Brazil. Volcanoes in Guatemala such as those framing the southern shores of Lake Atitl\xc3\xa1n considered by some to be one of the most beautiful places on the planet. Semuc Champey and the Lanquin caves in the Alta Verapaz District of Guatemala are unmissable. All these make this region a great yet undiscovered and affordable treasure which is worth visiting. [ edit ][ add listing ] Buy Just about every country in Central America accepts the U.S. Dollar. Other currencies are difficult to exchange. You can exchange Mexican Peso at the Belize Border or Guatemalan Border but that is about it. The U.S. Dollar is the official currency of El Salvador and Panama so there is no need to exchange money in these countries. You can buy pretty much anything or any service in U.S. dollars, but it might be sometimes cheaper to buy in the local currency. Currencies such as the C\xc3\xb3rdoba or the Lempira are usually highly inflated so only get what you need. Nearly all banks change money from U.S. Dollar to the local currency and a passport is usually required to do this. Beyond border towns, currencies are always useless when brought outside the country to change money with official money changers at borders. If bringing U.S. Cash to Central America, make sure that the bills are new, clean and not torn or it may not be exchanged. $2 bills are considered lucky so bring some for tips. Banks in Belize do not exchange the Guatemalan Quetzal; they must be changed at the border or at some travel agents and tour operators. ATMs can be found in banks and in major towns but in the country side it is often hard to find working ATMs. Most ATMs dispence the local currency and U.S. dollars. In Central America, you can often find cheap buys from gifts to personal necessities. Almost everything can be bargained for except for upscale department stores. Tourists will usually pay a higher price so this is where your haggling will be useful. [ edit ][ add listing ] Eat Guatemala is the country of tamales, there are regular tamales made out of corn "masa" with either meat, chicken, turkey or pork filling and tomato, and sometimes "chile". "Black tamales" are similar to the former ones but are sweet, "paches" are tamales made out of potatos, "tamales de cambray" are small sweet "masa" balls", tamales de "chipilin", and many others; rellenitos (sweet fried bean-stuffed banana bonbons) are a tasty dessert sold on streetcorners. Black beans are the main staple after corn of course. There is a variety of soups ("caldos"). Guatemalan cuisine is a mixture of Mayan and Spanish dishes. Gallo pinto is a mixture of rice and beans with a little cilantro or onion thrown in, it is the national dish of Nicaragua and Costa Rica This mixture is called Casamiento ("marriage")in El Salvador and Guatemala. And on the north coast of Honduras, casamiento is made with coconut milk. Pupusas and "chicharron con yuca" (pork skin & yucca) are very popular dishes originated in El Salvador. Nacatamales, which are big tamales containing pork, potato, rice, chile, tomato, and masa is steamed in platano leaves, they originate from Nicaragua and can be bought in the colonial city of Granada. Oven tamales, wraped with platano leaves, are very good in Costa Rica. Grilled octopus is a very tasty dish in Panama. [ edit ][ add listing ] Drink Horchata is a drink made out of rice and it is of Spanish origin. It is drunk in most Latin American countries. A popular drink in most central american countries is "Rosa de Jamaica" (Hibiscus sabdariffa. "Tamarindo" also makes a very popular drink Pi\xc3\xb1a Colada, a drink made from pineapple juice, coconut cream, crushed ice and rum, is drunk all around the Atlantic islands. There are two major rum producers in Guatemala, distilling some of the best rums of the region, Ron Zacapa Centenario (aged to 12 and 23 years) and Ron Botran a\xc3\xb1ejo (25 years). Flor de Ca\xc3\xb1a, rated one of the best rums in Latin America. It is made in Chichigalpa, Nicaragua. Trips can also be made to visit the Flor de Ca\xc3\xb1a factory. [ edit ] Stay safe Nicaragua , Panama and Costa Rica are generally safer than Honduras , Guatemala , El Salvador , and Belize , which suffer from the maras (street gangs) and also have the highest crime rates in the region. The police are often not seen as reliable or trustworthy. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights reported last year that Guatemala had the highest murder rate in all of Latin America , with 70.0 homicides per 100,000. In comparison, the murder rate in the United States is 5.6 homicides per 100,000. Night travel is dangerous anywhere in Central America, especially in national capitals. Illegal drugs are common in the region so stay clear! Crossing into South America overland might seem like a good idea when you look at a world map, however, it\'s not. The border to Colombia in Panama\'s Darien province is surrounded by a dangerous wilderness and the only break in the Pan-American Highway . Known as the Darien Gap, this is the playground of ruthless drug smugglers and militias who will be happy to kidnap or kill you. Unless you\'re a movie Predator, stay away. [ edit ] Stay healthy Toilets are not always as readily available as what you may be used to in your own country, so take advantage of places where they are such as museums and restaurants. In many cases toilet paper will not be provided so it is best not to be caught short and carry your own. Water to wash hands is not always available so carrying antiseptic hand gel is a good idea. Trash cans are provided in all toilets for the disposal of toilet paper because the sewage systems in Central America cannot cope with it. Mosquitos are quite common even in the dry season and bug spray is often hard to come by. Bring a spray high in DEET. To be extra safe, bring a bug net to sleep under. Malaria pills are a good idea but often expensive. See Tips for travel in developing countries [ edit ] Get out This article is an outline and needs more content.

[ edit ][ add listing ] Sleep The nearby towns of Blois and Amboise on the Loire River have a number of reasonably priced hotels. [ edit ] Get out Travellers wishing to see more of the Loire Valley can continue further east into the adjoining Centre-Val de Loire region, studded with additional historical cities and chateau\'s at sites such as Bourges and Saint-Beno\xc3\xaet-du-Sault . The nearby town of Blois is well worth a visit. Enjoy a 25 minute sightseeing trip around the town in a horse drawn carriage (6\xe2\x82\xac adults 4\xe2\x82\xac children - 2007), starts from the Place du Ch\xc3\xa2teau in Blois. Also here you will see the most incredible clock ever! - Maison de la Magie. The clock was designed by Robert-Houdin a famous french diplomat and inventor (Houdini was named after him). A short walk to the Cathedrale Saint Louis will be rewarded by its gargoyles and the gardens behind, with views of the Loire river. This article is an outline and needs more content.

Cotopaxi is the world\'s highest active volcano. Many cities and sites in Ecuador are listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Such cities and best known places are the Galapagos Islands , and the city of Cuenca . [ edit ] Understand The "Republic of the Ecuador" was one of three countries that emerged from the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others being Colombia and Venezuela). Between 1904 and 1942, Ecuador lost territories in a series of conflicts with its neighbors. A border war with Peru that flared in 1995 was resolved in 1999. [ edit ] Radio and Television Radio and/or television is available in Spanish except in some of the particularly remote areas. English-language movies usually are shown in the original language with Spanish subtitles. Many hotels have cable television that may include English-language stations and/or premium movie channels that feature subtitled movies in their original languages. [ edit ] Newspapers and Magazines Spanish-language newspapers and magazines can be purchased on the streets of cities but can be hard to find elsewhere. Some hotels catering to foreigners may have a small selection of English-language reading material. [ edit ] Money Ecuador adopted the United States dollar (USD) as its currency in 2000. [ edit ] Climate Tropical along coast, becoming cooler inland at higher elevations; tropical in Amazonian jungle lowlands [ edit ] Regions Amazon Rainforest Andean Highlands Coastal Lowlands Galapagos Islands Isolated archipelago that is world-renowned for its unique wildlife and Darwin\'s evolution research.

Chinese citizens need to approach the consulate for incorporation of a stamp in the passport before entry to Ecuador. [ edit ] By plane Quito \'s airport has an executive lounge shared by all the airlines with drinks, snacks, and seating areas. The view is not of the airplanes and runway, but there is a view of the airport entrance and the surrounding mountains. Business class travelers get a free invitation. Another port of entry is Guayaquil , which has a modern airport that includes the typical amenities such as restaurants and duty-free shopping. The airport is located north from downtown. The Galapagos Islands are one of the Ecuadorian provinces and have two airports, one of which is on Baltra and the other is on San Cristobal. Aerogal is the name of the airline which flies to Galapagos. All the flights are through the mainland. The Quito airport charges an international departure tax of $40.80. The tax is $26 from Guayaquil. This tax is already included in the cost of the flight since February 2011. [ edit ] By train There are no international train services into Ecuador. The national railroad from Quito to Guayaquil (Via Lactacunga and Riobamba) is being rebuilt, but in the meantime, several sections are running for tourists. The most popular is the the Alausi to Nariz del Diablo section (this has resumed service in 2011 after a 4.6 million dollar renovation). [ edit ] By car Driving into Ecuador is discouraged. It is preferable to enter the country by airplane or boat because of the frontier issues with neighboring countries. [ edit ] By bus [ edit ] To/from Colombia The only crossing between Ecuador and Colombia is at Rumichaca near Tulcan and Ipiales . [ edit ] To/from Peru There are several places to cross the border with Peru , though Huaquillas (near Machala gets the vast majority of the tourist crossings. Macara and La Balsa (near Zumba ) are the other options. [ edit ] By boat Since Ecuador is situated at the coast and has some very large rivers, a boat ride can be a nice way to get around. Especially in the rainforest a boat ride can get you to places you usually wouldn\'t be able to go. [ edit ] Get around The best way to discover the wonders of the four regions of Ecuador is through a Tour Operator. [ edit ] By bus Intercity buses travel to almost everywhere in Ecuador. All the intercity bus routes and schedules are available online at ecuadorschedules.com Many cities have a central bus terminal, known as the terminal terrestre, where it is possible to buy tickets from the various bus lines that serve the city. Long-distance buses typically cost from $1 to $2 per hour, depending on the distance and the type of service; groups may be able to negotiate discounts. Buses are frequent along major routes. Reservations or advance purchases usually aren\'t needed except during peak periods such as holidays. The bathroom on the bus, if any, is usually reserved for women. However, it is permissible for men to request that the bus make a stop so that they might relieve themselves. The bus rides themselves are often quite beautiful, through mountain views in the clouds. These altitude changes cause many of the same ear pressure problems which are associated with an airplane ride. The bus driver will stop along the way to board additional passengers. Many buses arrive at their destination with passengers standing in the aisle. There are a few first class buses, called "Ejecutivo", which cost a little more than the regular busses. They are generally more comfortable and safer. [ edit ] By car Although there is a possibility to rent a car and drive around Ecuador DON\'T. Like many countries around the world, Ecuador\xe2\x80\x99s driving laws are few and rarely (if ever) enforced. Deciding to drive will be taking your life into your own hands. Perhaps if you will just be driving around cities like Guayaquil or Quito it is slightly safer but to drive around the countryside would be insanity. On top of the poor driving skills, Ecuadorian roads are rarely maintained (especially along the coast). Potholes are numerous and it is highly likely it will take out a tire or two if you do end up hitting one. However, over the last 5 years a massive investment has been put forth to re-build the road network (USD 4600 millions, according to the Ministry of public works and transport [2] ). There is still a huge network of secondary roads, which suffer from the problems stated above, but the main roads leading to major tourist destinations have good infrastructure and are generally thoroughly signalled. [ edit ] By taxi Taxis are widely available. Taxis are generally yellow and have the taxi license number prominently displayed. Taxis in Quito have meters (fares under $1 are rounded up to the minimum fare of $1). Agree upon a price before getting in or ask the driver to use the meter (often cheaper than a negotiated rate); short trips generally don\'t cost more than $1 or $2, and you generally shouldn\'t end up paying more than $10 per hour, if that, for longer trips. Evening rates are often double. As with any country in Latin America, (or the world for that matter), don\'t ride an unlicensed taxi. It\'s a great way to get kidnapped. [ edit ] By plane Domestic flights to major cities on the mainland costs from $50-$100 one-way, and there are sometimes roundtrip promotions for about the same price. You can find domestic flight schedules online at ecuadorschedules.com and individual airlines\' schedules on their sites. Flights between the biggest cities are in jets, and some of the smaller cities are served by prop aircraft. The domestic airlines in Ecuador are LanEcuador, Tame, Aerogal and Saereo. Most of the airlines in Ecuador offer excellent service and relatively new planes. You can buy domestic air tickets from agents or directly from the airlines - some sell tickets online and you can buy them at the airport or ticket offices for those who don\'t. [ edit ] By hitchhiking Hitchhiking is possible in Ecuador. A lot of people drive pick-ups which you can easily throw your backpack into if they give you a lift. On roads not frequently serviced by buses, cargo trucks may take on riders or hitchhikers, either to ride in back or in the cabin. In some cases the driver charges the going bus fare, in others he may simply be taking on a rider for the company and refuse a fare. [ edit ] Talk Spanish is the official language. Amerindian languages (especially Quechua ) are generally spoken in the more rural, mountainous villages. English is widely spoken in hotels, restaurants and other businesses that cater to high-end travelers. Ecuadorians are friendly and generally tolerant of foreigners who attempt to speak Spanish but make mistakes. [ edit ][ add listing ] Do The capital Quito , is a city with a lot of history where you can walk in downtown, enjoying the beautiful colonial buildings. There is also the "Telef\xc3\xa9rico" (cable-car) which takes passengers from the highest mountain in Quito to see the whole city from the sky. Admission is $8.50 per person (November 2010). There are many welcoming cafes as well as many dancing clubs open every weekend, often until 5AM. In Guayaquil , an excellent place to visit is the Malec\xc3\xb3n 2000, which is very similar to Navy Pier in Chicago , Illinois , offering food, shopping, boat rides and a beautiful view of the river. Except for electronics, prices are quite low; however, almost everything sold with any sort of brand name is a knockoff. This area is very well patrolled and quite safe. For a real adventure, it is possible to visit the more authentic, less expensive, and far more dangerous Bah\xc3\xada or "Informal Market". It is not advisable to visit it without a native. It is possible to purchase a knockoff of almost anything here. Pirated video games and movies also abound; it is possible to purchase game systems modified to play such games as well. Make the proprietors prove to you that any movies or games you might purchase actually work before buying though. In the Bah\xc3\xada, it is necessary to haggle for all items. Ba\xc3\xb1os is the perfect city for the outdoors or extreme sports enthusiast, offering rafting, mountain climbing and backpacking excursions of all sorts. It is possible to get an English speaking guide. Be sure to get all the necessary vaccinations, as it is possible to get some nasty infections from prolonged exposure to the water. Ba\xc3\xb1os also offers a public hot spring mineral bath, which only charges $1 admission. Other, more expensive baths also exist, but are fed from the exact same water. It is best to arrive at these baths as they open, as the water is freshest and cleanest then. The Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve is probably the best place to see the Amazon Rainforest in Ecuador, even though there are other national parks which are also interesting (such as the Yasuni National Park). It is a place of high biodiversity and nature lovers should feel in paradise. That is a good way to discover the indigenous communities of Ecuador and to eventually meet a local shaman. It is necessary to get to Lago Agrio to reach the reserve. Private transportation is made possible by the local accommodation, which is provided by eco-lodges. Ibarra -and the whole Imbabura province- is about a 90mins ride from Quito and offers many touristic activities such as community tourism, adventure tours (rafting, swing jumping, kayaking, trekking, etc) and indigenous visits. The most recommended places in Imbabura to visit are: Ibarra, Otavalo, Intag and Cotacachi The north of Ecuador offers the best beaches, including Bahia de Caraquez, Manta, Crucita, San Jacinto, and San Clemente. They offer very inexpensive hotel accommodations, great food and friendly people. Ecuador is perhaps the most bio-diverse country in the world. The Galapagos Islands are justly famed for their wildlife, but there is also lots to see on the mainland. Ecuador has over one hundred different types of hummingbirds. Good places to see them include Cuyabeno Wild Life Reserve , Mindo and San Luis de Pambil . Monta\xc3\xb1ita Town In the coast, 3 hours from Guayaquil, This is a growing town with many particularies which makes it great to visit: Goog Beach and incredible surroundings, the people, incredible nightlife, and surf. There are many people who live in the town permanently from all over the world. [ edit ] Volunteer Many people who visit Ecuador choose to give back to the community by volunteering. The Peace Corps alone has more than 200 volunteers in Ecuador at a time. From conservation projects to building houses to teaching English, there are many ways to help development in Ecuador. You can choose to volunteer through a third-party organization that arranges accommodations and connects you to a local organization to volunteer with. The other option is to volunteer directly through a local NGO. This will take more time and research but can also be significantly cheaper. [ edit ] Cinema One way to work on your Spanish skills is to go to a movie. Films in modern theaters cost about $3 to $4 in the larger cities, less in smaller towns. Foreign films are typically shown in the original language with subtitles - but not always, so ask first. [ edit ] Learn [ edit ] Spanish Classes Quito is a great place to learn Spanish, the accent in Quito is soft and clear and easy to understand. Quite a few private Spanish academies exist, they offer one on one and group courses with personalized programs that focus on grammar but also in helping to improve speaking and comunicational skills in a short period of time. Quality varies greatly, so check reviews online and speak to current students before enrolling. Students who want to learn spanish for longer periods and in big groups might consider the programs of two Ecuadorian universities which offer semester length Spanish as a Second Language classes for foreigners. University study is ideal if you are serious about learning Spanish and have the time to complete the full program. Successful completion of a university Spanish program may also allow to continue studying at that university or even to earn a degree. On the other hand, if you wish to learn Spanish while enjoying being on the beach, then Monta\xc3\xb1ita is the best place to learn. [ edit ] Formal University Study While all universities in Ecuador can theoretically admit foreign students, most have onerous entry requirements and will not admit students for just a semester or two. Two universities -- Universidad San Francisco and Catholic University -- stand out for extending a welcome to foreign students, who can choose to study for a semester or even complete a full Bachelor\'s or Master\'s degree. Be sure to inquire about enrollment (matricula) costs which are usually above and beyond normal tuition. Obtain a student visa, if needed, before you enter Ecuador to study. Catholic University of Ecuador [3] Universidad San Francisco de Quito [4] [ edit ][ add listing ] Buy Ecuador uses the U.S. dollar as its currency. Other types of currency are not readily accepted. U.S. paper money is used for most transactions. Ecuador has its own coins, which are exactly the same size and weight as U.S. coins up through 50-cent pieces; both they and U.S. coins are used. U.S. Sacagawea dollar coins are also widely used, more so than in the U.S. Susan B. Anthony dollars, however, are not generally accepted. Many merchants examine large bills ($10 and above) carefully to make sure they aren\'t counterfeit. Frequently, businesses will not accept fifty dollar bills or hundred dollar bills at all. One must usually go to a bank in order to break hundred dollar bills. Outside of tourist areas and Quito, many merchants do not keep large amounts of money on hand, so getting change for bills large and small may be difficult. This is especially true on cheaper buses. Take lots of one and five dollar bills with you; you will also want to bring the newest possible bills. Worn bills are often regarded with suspicion, and it is not uncommon for a merchant to ask you to pay with another bill if the one you handed them appears old or worn. Travelers\' checks can be exchanged at some (but not all) banks for a reasonable fee (usually not more than 3 percent). They are also accepted at some hotels that cater to tourists, although it is difficult to use them elsewhere. There is often a surcharge added to use traveler\'s checks. Credit and debit cards are accepted at many places that cater to tourists as well as at some upscale shops. However, many places charge a commission for their use as reimbursement for what the banks charge them. You may be asked to show your passport when using a credit or debit card. Automated teller machines are widely available in major cities and tourist areas. Most claim to be tied in with major international networks, in theory making it possible to withdraw money from foreign accounts. Depending on the transaction fees charged by your bank at home, ATMs offer very good exchange rates. Be aware that you may have to try quite a few different machines before receiving money. TIP: Banco Austro is the only national bank chain that doesn\'t charge a withdrawal fee. The others have learned a cue from the States, and typically charge $1 or more per transaction. Avoid using ATMs on the street as their users are frequently targeted by street thieves. Hotels or other places with a guard nearby are your best choices. Prices vary widely in Ecuador. Costs at upscale hotels and restaurants seem to be close, maybe 10 percent less, to what they would be in the United States. Outside of tourist areas, costs are much less. It is possible to get a meal at a clean restaurant for under $2 or to pay less than $10 for a clean but basic hotel room. Even though Ecuador is a very beautiful country, it does not know how to sell itself very well. In Quito, a very famous touristic site is El Mercado Artesenal where many souvenirs can be found but after a thorough look around you will realize that there is a bit of redundancy in the items in the sense that everyone is basically selling the same thing. Therefore, after buying a few main items it becomes difficult to find much more variety. Almost everything that can be bought has a price that can be bargained. If you are not a native, they will try and get higher prices out of you, which is why it is recommended to go with someone who is either fluent in Spanish or native to bargain more effectively. [ edit ] Cuisine Throughout the country there is a lot of variety as to what is typically eaten, depending on the location. In the Sierra, potatoes almost always accompany lunch and dinner, and in the coast rice is popular. Soup is also a big part of lunch and dinner. Breakfasts often consist of toast, eggs, and juice or fruit. Batidos, or fruit shakes, are popular breakfast items or snacks. Especially in the Coastline, Ecuadorians make a variety of breakfast meals based on green or sweet plantain and yuca, such as bolonoes, empanadas, patacones, corviches, muchines, pan de yuca, humitas and others. They are cooked with either cheese, pork or fish. They are very filling and unexpensive meals. Locro de Papa Restaurants run the gamut in terms of menu, quality, hygiene, hours and price. Basic meals can be had for less than $2, or it is possible to pay close to U.S. prices in the tourist areas, especially for food from the American chains. If you\'re on a budget, your best bet for a good and local meal is to order an almuerzo (lunch) or a merienda (dinner). These normally consist of a soup, a meat main course and a dessert for $1-$2. More expensive restaurants (say, ones that charge $4 per meal or more) often add a 12% sales tax and a 10% service fee. Coffee or tea (including many herbal varieties) is typically served after the meal unless you ask for it sooner. Except at places that cater to foreigners, it is the custom not to present the diner with the bill until it is requested. While many servers are used to rude tourists, rubbing your fingers together isn\'t as accepted as in Europe although it\'s not considered downright rude as in the United States. The best way to get the check is to tell your server "La Cuenta, Por Favor." Smoking is allowed in most restaurants, but the law explicitly prohibits smoking in closed areas, so it\'s a good idea to ask for a smoking section, or ask if the restaurant allows smoking. Cuy or Guinea Pig Locro de papa is a famous Ecuadorian soup with avocados, potatoes and cheese. Ceviche is a common dish found on the coast. It is a cold seafood cocktail that is usually served with "chifles," thin fried plantains, and popcorn. Encebollado is a hearty fish soup with yuca, also found on the coast: A tomato-fish soup filled with chunks of yucca, marinated vegetables with "chifles" thrown in for added crunch. In the Highlands, Ecuadorians eat cuy, or guinea pig . The entire animal is roasted or fried and often served skewered on a stick. Empanadas are also a common local food that are usually consumed as snacks in the afternoon. The most common varieties of this filled pastry are cheese and/or chicken. [ edit ][ add listing ] Drink Bottled water is very common and is safe to drink; it comes con gas (carbonated) and sin gas (non-carbonated). Water from the tap is unsafe to drink. Even Ecuadorians generally only drink bottled (or boiled) water. Coffee is widely available in cafes and restaurants, and also sold in bean form. Tea is also common, usually with a good selection including herbal. Fruit juice is plentiful and good, and you will often have many options: pi\xc3\xb1a (pineapple), mora (blackberry), maracuy\xc3\xa1 (passion fruit), naranja (orange), sand\xc3\xada (watermelon), naranjilla (a jungle fruit), melon, taxo, guanabana, guava, etc. If you\'d like it made with milk, sort of like a less-frozen milkshake, ask for a batida . Note that often juices are served lukewarm. Aguardiente , often made from fermented sugar cane, is the local firewater. If possible, have some ground freshly into your cup from the sugarcane. [ edit ][ add listing ] Sleep There are many low-cost hostels that can be found throughout Ecuador. Often, the hostels in smaller towns are actually privately owned homes that welcome travellers. As with most things, natives can help you find an excellent hotel at a very low price ($6-14). Again, large groups will be able to bargain for lower prices. Air conditioning is an amenity which often comes at an extra cost of a dollar or two a night. Ecuador is also home to an increasing number of Eco Lodges , including many renovated, traditional Haciendas. Haciendas of Ecuador [ edit ] Stay safe Tourists should use common sense to ensure their safety. Avoid problems by not flashing large amounts of money, not visiting areas near the Colombian border, staying away from civil disturbances and not using side streets in big cities at night. Probably the biggest threat in most places is simple thievery: Belongings should not be left unguarded on the beach, for example, and pickpockets can be found in some of the more crowded areas, especially the Trol\xc3\xa9bus (Metro) in Quito, in bus terminals and on the buses themselves. Buses allow peddlers to board briefly and attempt to sell their wares; however, they are often thieves themselves, so keep a close eye out for them. Hotel personnel are generally good sources of information about places that should be avoided. You can always ask tourist police officers, police officers or in Tourist information center for the dangerous regions. Ecuador offers great opportunities for hiking and climbing, unfortunately, some travelers have been attacked and robbed in remote sections of well known climbs - several rapes have also been reported so female hikers/climbers need to be extremely careful. Travelers are urged to avoid solo hikes and to go in a large group for safety reasons. [ edit ] Stay healthy Ecuador is widely considered to be a developing country and health hazards are a significant issue. Of the most significant are foodborne illnesses, though they can easily be treated with digestive drugs such as antacids or antidiarrheals. Bottled water is key in Ecuador if you don\'t want to get sick. This doesn\'t only apply to foreigners who don\'t have the stomach for Ecuadorian food but also Ecuadorians who know that if they don\'t boil their water or drink it from the bottle that they can get very sick. As a result, it can be purchased almost everywhere (even in the most remote places) for well under $.25-.50. Water bottles are sometimes provided by hostels and hotels, which can be used for brushing teeth. It is advisable to receive a typhoid vaccination, and possibly a yellow fever vaccination, depending on your specific area of travel. Outside the major cities and tourist areas, malaria can be a problem along the coast during the rainy season. [ edit ] Respect The common greetings are "Buenos d\xc3\xadas", "Buenas tardes" or "Buenas noches", (Good morning, Good afternoon, and Good evening, respectively). It is usually complemented by a handshake, between men, and by a kiss on the cheek between women or between a man and a woman. "Hola" is the most common greeting between friends and acquaintances. Note that, as in most Latin American countries, it\'s considered normal and polite to stand quite close to the other person while talking. If you speak Spanish with Ecuadorians commoners, take note of the difference between the two forms for the pronoun "you": the informal "t\xc3\xba" and the formal "usted". It\'s customary to address older people and people with whom you\'re not familiar with "usted". Ecuadorans are generally forgiving of non-native speakers, but use "usted" when in doubt. Among many other cultural idiosyncrasies, in the Sierra regions it is considered impolite to use a downward-facing palm as a reference for the height of a person. Instead, the hand is held on its side, and the measurement taken from the lower edge to the floor. Gesturing with the palm down is appropriate for animals only. When motioning for someone to "come here," it is impolite to motion your hand with the palm facing up. Instead, use a downward swipe of the hand with the palm facing down. Acceptable clothing varies by region of the country. In the mountainous Sierra region, including Quito, clothes are usually more warm because of the weather. On the coast, meanwhile, more casual clothes predominate. [ edit ] Contact [ edit ] Internet Internet cafes can be found nearly everywhere in the major cities and in many of the smaller ones. Cost is from $1 to $2 per hour in the large cities, and the better places have high-speed access. In some cafes, restaurants, and hotels you can find free wifi access, most of them protected by passwords; in most cases, you just have to ask for the password. [ edit ] Telephone For most visitors, the easiest place to make phone calls is an Internet cafe, most of which provide VoIP service at reasonable rates. You can call the United States for about $0.10 per minute and Europe for a bit more. Avoid making a phone call through an operator; the cost for an international call can be $3 or more per minute. For calls within Ecuador, it is possible to use a telephone cabin. This is an entire storefront filled with telephones. Generally, you are assigned a booth by the proprietor, you make your call, then you pay as you leave. Calls within Ecuador are more expensive than domestic calls in most countries, but not unreasonable, except for calls to cell phones, which generate most of their revenue by charging the caller. Also, call prices increase depending on the distance of your call within Ecuador, based on city, province, etc. Visitors making an extended stay should consider purchasing a cell phone. Most are sold on a prepaid-call basis, and phone refill cards can be purchased in all but the smallest towns. It is also possible to get a modern GSM cellular phone "unlocked" so that it will function in Ecuador (you can take your own phone, if it compatible with GSM 850MHz), however, this should be reserved for emergencies as the cost of actually making such a call is usually exorbitant (about $0,45 per minute).

The world famous Neuschwanstein Castle [2] is situated a few kilometres to the east. Some visitors come to tour the castles and leave immediately afterwards leaving the beautiful little town unexplored. This is a great pity as there is much to see in F\xc3\xbcssen and the surrounding area if you know what you are looking for! There are magnificant lakes with beautiful views and the "Kalvarienberg" which has the "Stations of the Cross" on it. [ edit ] Get in By train: There are many connections to F\xc3\xbcssen from Munich and vice versa. Direct trains leave about every two hours. Other options require a change of trains along the way in another city.

There is a bus to the castles and the trains to Munich and Augsburg and the old town is easy enough to access by foot. You can walk to Neuschwanstein and Hochschwangau castles via some marked roads; travel times posted on the signboards are comfortable over-estimates. There are some great areas nearby, like some of the lesser-known castles, which would be easier to reach with your own car. It is possible to rent a car in F\xc3\xbcssen. Another alternative is to rent a mountain bike. There are numerous shops, one even right at the train station.

S'Himeji travel guide - Wikitravel Help Wikitravel grow by contributing to an article! Learn how . Himeji From Wikitravel Kansai : Hyogo : Himeji Jump to: navigation , search Contents [+] Get in By plane By train By bus [+] Get around On foot By bus See Do Buy Eat Drink Sleep Get out Himeji Castle Himeji ( \xe5\xa7\xab\xe8\xb7\xaf ; [1] ) is a small city at the western edge of the Kansai region of Japan with Japan\'s finest castle. At one point in the late 1500\'s, it was the biggest castle in all of Asia. The city has been featured in a series of Japanese and foreign films due to its picturesque old-Japan look. The information office at the JR station has props from some of these films including, for example, props from the film Last Samurai. [ edit ] Get in [ edit ] By plane Himeji does not have its own airport. The nearest international airport is Kansai International Airport ; buses run eight times a day to Himeji station (about 2 1/4 hours, \xc2\xa53200 for a one way ticket). The nearest domestic airports are in Kobe and Osaka . By train from Kobe Airport, take the Port Liner to Sannomiya and connect to the shin-kaisoku train service to Himeji (about one hour with good connection, \xc2\xa51270), or take a bus straight to Himeji station (1 1/4 hours, \xc2\xa51300, six per day). From Osaka\'s Itami Airport, there are direct buses every hour or so to Himeji station (1 hour 20 minutes, \xc2\xa52100). A 700-series shinkansen train entering Himeji station. [ edit ] By train Himeji is along the Sanyo shinkansen line (\xe5\xb1\xb1\xe9\x99\xbd\xe6\x96\xb0\xe5\xb9\xb9\xe7\xb7\x9a) from Osaka and Kobe to Okayama and Hiroshima . The Hikari Rail Star offers frequent service to Himeji within the Sanyo region, as do the all-stopping Kodama trains. As the station is raised it is possible to see Himeji Castle from a passing train. From Tokyo , one Nozomi train per hour runs through to Himeji, covering the journey in just over three hours (\xc2\xa515710). If you have a Japan Rail Pass, there is also one Hikari train departing each hour, running through to Himeji, which you can take at no charge. Due to additional stops, the Hikari takes 3 hours and 40 minutes to reach Himeji from Tokyo. An inexpensive method of reaching Himeji from within the Kansai region is to take one of the frequent Shinkaisoku (\xe6\x96\xb0\xe5\xbf\xab\xe9\x80\x9f - Special Rapid) commuter trains on the JR Kobe line (JR \xe7\xa5\x9e\xe6\x88\xb8\xe7\xb7\x9a) that begins in Osaka, which charges only the price of a local train. The ride takes 38 minutes from Kobe \'s Sannomiya station (\xc2\xa5950) or 57 minutes from Osaka (\xc2\xa51450). It is possible to travel from Osaka to Himeji using direct trains over the private Hanshin and Sanyo Railways but as this takes longer than JR (one and a half hours, \xc2\xa51250) it is only really worthwhile for holders of the 3 day or 5 day pass for Kansai\'s private railway system. From Kyoto , the Hikari shinkansen whisks travellers to Himeji in just under an hour. This trip can be taken without charge by Japan Rail Pass holders. [ edit ] By bus Shinki Bus runs an overnight service from Tokyo ( Shinjuku and Shibuya ) to Himeji at a cost of \xc2\xa59450 one way and \xc2\xa517010 round trip. As of October 2009, the bus leaves the Shinjuku Highway Bus Terminal at 22:30 and arrives at the Himeji Bus Terminal at 8:00, with the return leaving Himeji at 21:30 and getting to Shinjuku at 7:00. [ edit ] Get around [ edit ] On foot To see the castle, as well as many of the other sites, it\'s only a 10-15 minute walk down Otemae-d\xc5\x8dri from the station. Along the way, you\'ll also pass shopping centers and souvenir shops. [ edit ] By bus The Sightseeing Loop Bus is a cheap and convenient alternative that makes a loop around the cultural area, with stops near the castle, garden, and museums. It only costs \xc2\xa5100 to ride, regardless of where you get off. It only takes 5 minutes to get to the castle. The Loop Bus only covers the area around the castle, so for those wanting to visit sites beyond this area, such as Engyoji, you will need to take the city bus. [ edit ][ add listing ] See Himeji Castle gun racks Himeji Castle ( \xe5\xa7\xab\xe8\xb7\xaf\xe5\x9f\x8e Himeji-j\xc5\x8d ), ( An easy 10-minute walk north from the station; also accessible by bus. ), [2] . The castle is open 9 AM to 5 PM daily (admission is only until 4 PM) or until 6 PM (admission is until 5 PM) from June until August. The castle is closed between December 29 \xe2\x80\x93 31.) . Dating to 1609 and also graced with the name "White Egret Castle" (\xe7\x99\xbd\xe9\xb7\xba\xe5\x9f\x8e Shirasagi-j\xc5\x8d ), this striking white edifice is generally considered the most beautiful of Japan\'s castles and is one of the few that has escaped the ravages of civil war, earthquakes and firebombings. Most notably, the castle miraculously survived World War II virtually unscathed, despite the rest of the city having been levelled by American carpet bombing. The castle was designated as a national treasure in 1931 and was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1993. It is virtually the last castle in Japan that still manages to tower over the surrounding skyscrapers and office buildings. Admission is \xc2\xa5600 adults and \xc2\xa5200 children. A special \xc2\xa5720 combination ticket gets you into both the castle and the nearby K\xc5\x8dkoen Garden. A free guided tour in English is included \'\'if\'\' a guide happens to be available (no reservations are possible) . \xc2\xa0 edit NOTE: Himeji Castle is currently undergoing renovation until spring 2015 . It will stay open throughout, but parts may be off-limits and a large tent-like structure is covering the entire main building of castle. As of Sept 1, 2011 , the interior of the main keep was closed to visitors, and the structure itself is covered up. For an additional 200 yen on top of the 300 yen entry fee, you can take an elevator to the top of the main keep to see the work in progress. A series of other parts of the castle complex have been opened up to compensate including some that are generally not open to the public. Although the image of the castle towering over the city is a key reason many people visit Himeji, the covered-up castle is still worth a visit. A live image of the castle may be seen here: http://www.winknet.ne.jp/ K\xc5\x8dkoen Garden ( \xe5\xa5\xbd\xe5\x8f\xa4\xe5\x9c\x92 kokoen ), ( Located right next to the western edge of Himeji Castle\'s outer moat ), [3] . Open from 9 AM daily and closes at either 5 PM or 6PM (last admission at 4:30 PM or 5:30 PM) depending on the time of year . This magnificent collection of nine Edo-period-style walled gardens was laid out in 1992 on a site where samurai houses once stood. The street plan and gated partitions preserve the appearance of the old residential quarter, except that within the various enclosures visitors find beautifully landscaped gardens and water features instead of noble residences. There is a tea arbour and a restaurant within the grounds, but eating and drinking outside of these places is prohibited. Admission is \xc2\xa5300 adults and \xc2\xa5150 children. A special \xc2\xa5720 combination ticket gets you into both K\xc5\x8dkoen and Himeji Castle . \xc2\xa0 edit Hyogo Prefectural Museum of History , ( Across the street from Himeji City Museum of Art ), [4] . Open from 10 AM to 5 PM. Closed Mondays . Unlike most prefectural museums, this one actually has very little information about Hyogo prefecture\'s history, and historical artifacts also tend to be lacking, so if you really want to learn more about Hyogo, you may be disappointed however, if you are interested in Japanese history as a whole, this museum is well worth visiting. It contains replicas of all twelve original castles remaining in Japan, has a room dedicated to festivals (while they feature Hyogo festivals, most are done nationwide), and toys throughout history. There is an art gallery, as well, which often features some of Japan\'s most interesting artwork. The artwork is not limited to Hyogo artists. Check the website to see what will be displayed when you arrive. Entrance fee \xc2\xa5200 yen (adult), \xc2\xa5150 college and high school students. During special exhibitions admission changes, typically to around \xc2\xa5700. . \xc2\xa0 edit Himeji City Museum of Art , \xe2\x98\x8e 079-222-2288 . Open 10AM to 5PM . Features artwork from local artists and European art, along with special exhibitions. \xc2\xa5200 (prices are raised during special exhibitions) . \xc2\xa0 edit Senhime Shrine , ( On the flank of Otokoyama, towards the castle ). This is the only shrine in Japan associated with a castle. While the shrine itself is rather small and not very interesting, travelling up the stairs to the next lookout reveals a spectacular view of Himeji Castle. \xc2\xa0 edit Himeji City Zoo , 68 Honmachi, Himeji, 670-0012 ( In the park in front of the castle. ), \xe2\x98\x8e 079-284-3636 , [5] . 9am-5pm . This zoo has a pretty comprehensive array of animals, but usually only one of each and all in very small cages or enclosures. Entry Y200 . \xc2\xa0 edit Engyo-ji Temple , ( A 30 minute bus ride from Himeji castle on the orange bus #8 ). The beautiful temple complex is best known among the locals as the setting for part of Tom Cruise\'s "The Last Samurai". Mount Shosha, where the temple complex is located, is particularly beautiful in the fall, when the Japanese maples change colors. \xc2\xa5300 entrance + \xc2\xa5900 cable car return trip . \xc2\xa0 edit Tegarayama , southwest of Himeji castle, with an aquarium and small amusement park. Asago Sculpture Park , 30 minutes by car or train is a large sculpture park and museum. [ edit ][ add listing ] Do Himeji Castle is particularly striking (and crowded) in cherry blossom season in April, when all the trees planted in and around the castle burst into white splendor. Most people visit only the Castle and the area between the castle and the station. However, the area around the castle is a great place for a refreshing walk or a picnic. For families in particular, the park behind Himeji castle offers a decent play structure and ample space to sit down and have a picnic in the shadow of Japan\'s most famous castle. Nada Matsuri Aboshi Matsuri Himeji Ceramics market Himeji has a number of matsuri (festivals) throughout the year. Cherry Blossom Viewing Party , usually around the second Sunday in April. Lots of koto and taiko drumming. Yukata Matsuri - mid June, runs 2-3 days. Locals criticize this festival for having no roots or real reason to exist other than an opportunity for girls to dress up in summer yukata, eat delicious food from booths, and play fair games. Which is a good enough reason to go. This festival is always packed and makes for great people-watching, as many kinds of Japanese subcultures are on display. Oshiro Matsuri - early august. A large parade down the main street ending at Himeji castle. There is also a big stage to see lots of dancing, which can range from either very traditional to very hip. Often it\'s a combination of the two. Moon viewing - in September near the time of the Harvest moon. Features traditional plays and drums. [ edit ][ add listing ] Buy Himeji isn\'t particularly famous for crafts or goods. Wind chimes made of iron tongs and white leather accessories are popular higher-end Himeji souvenirs, and they can be bought in many of the department stores or along the Miyuki dori shopping arcade. There are also numerous shops along the route to the castle selling a variety of Himeji Castle and other assorted souvenirs. Additionally, the streets in the area surrounding Himeji Station are filled with shopping arcades (particularly Miyuki dori) and the usual department stores (there are several lining the way to the Castle, including Sanyo, Forus, and Yamatoyashiki.) Plie , located inside Himeji station. There are two sections. The section next to the North exit consists of women\'s clothing stores, zakka (home goods) stores, and a large Junkudo book shop. The other section consists of some omiyage (food gift) shops and a few restaurants like McDonald\'s and KFC. Sanyo department store , part of Sanyo station (North of Himeji JR station, on the West side of the main street). A standard department store with a variety of goods on multiple floors, including a small LOFT (a popular chain of stores that sells hip accessories, stickers, home goods and pop culture items). Festa , located on the northeast corner outside of Himeji station, has a small selection of stores. Animate , running perpendicular to the shopping arcade next to Miyukidori (turn at the 7-11 and taiyaki corner shops), Animate has two floors for those into anime and manga. The ground floor has a large selection of manga and doujinshi for all tastes and ages. The second floor has anime goods, CD soundtracks, and DVDs. Bon Marche , there are two in the station area, one on Miyukidori close to the castle, and one tucked behind and between Sanyo department store and Mitsubishi UFJ Bank (left hand side of Otemae dori). These gourmet grocery stores stock an impressive (though sometimes pricey) selection of foods, including some import foods. Daiso , located above the Bon Marche behind Sanyo department store, is arguably the largest 100-yen store in Himeji. This store is made up of three floors, and sell goods that run the gamut from housewares to clothes, electronics to food - most (but not all) available for \xc2\xa5100 apiece. A great place to pick up cheap souvenirs for your friends back home, but getting there and getting out can be a bit inconvenient. Additionally, for those who prefer the finer smokeables, there is a tobacco shop just off of Miyuki dori (turn right at the Fujifilm corner shop) on the right hand side just past the Softbank store that, in an unusual move for Japanese tobacconists, sells a variety of cigars. Not the top quality Cubans, mind you, but decent enough (and rare-in-Japan) "hamaki" (cigars). [ edit ][ add listing ] Eat As you exit the station facing the castle (North), the main shopping street (Miyuki dori) will be on your right and the main entertainment area on your left. Both areas have some fine restaurants. Himeji has a full selection of foods, from fast food (Western and Japanese) to gourmet dining. For breakfast there are countless coffee shops, including a Starbucks that has small waffles. Vegetarians in Himeji would do well to visit either Baobab or Everest. Baobab is a pan-Asian restaurant with an English menu for lunch and dinner, located just east of SMBC bank on Miyuki-dori, the main shopping arcade. Everest is a Nepalese (and Indian) restaurant just West of Himeji Station. Everest also has an English menu and the owner and chef also speaks English fluently. Koba and More , a small ramen shop with a jazz theme that is famous among the local expat crowd for its unusual Milk Ramen. Koba is the owner and ramen chef. Open 11:30-2:30 for lunch and 7:00-11:00 for dinner (6:00-11:00 on Saturdays). Closed on Thursdays. Walking towards the castle on the main road (Otemae-Dori), Take a right when you get to Yamato Yashiki department store. Take the second left. Kobe and More is on the left, look for the hanging beaded curtain. Sakura-saku , Honmachi 68, Himeji 670-0917. Vegetarian-friendly restaurant (also a kind of greengrocer\'s) with nice open-air frontage and view of Himeji castle. You can get a fantastic veggie meal of (for example) rice with peas, tofu steak and pumpkin, pickles, soup, dessert with coffee, and all the green tea you can drink, all for \xc2\xa51000. From the intersection in front of the castle, facing towards JR Himeji station, walk down the main street towards the station, go right at the first set of traffic lights you reach, and it\'s a few buildings down on your left. Starbucks , Located on the first floor of the Forus shopping building. Subway , the American sandwich chain, is a 5-minute walk north from JR Himeji station on Miyuki dori. There is a 24 hour McDonald\'s on the east side of Himeji JR station, for those of you who fancy something quick, simple and recognizable. [ edit ][ add listing ] Drink Himeji has two main bars that cater to foreigners. These bars tend to be frequented mostly by foreigners living in the city. Nobu , [6] . Nobu is a tiny, cramped little bar with English-speaking Japanese and foreign staff. It may be small; but Nobu is a friendly place. This bar is frequented mainly by a younger crowd, mostly English teachers. Hosanna Irish/British Pub . The city\'s resident Irish Pub, except that the city\'s small Irish population tend to avoid it at all costs. Serving good food in a warm and relaxing setting, Hosanna is expensive and a bit lifeless but some members of the staff speak very good English. [ edit ][ add listing ] Sleep Most people visit Himeji as a day/half day trip. Like most Japanese cities, there are a number of inexpensive business hotels clustered around the station. For example: Toyoko Inn , 97 Minami-Ekimae-cho , [7] . This simple business hotel is located right next to the train station. Rooms are smallish, but the price includes internet in the room and Japanese-style breakfast. (Double room \xc2\xa58,000) \xc2\xa0 edit Hotel Nikko Himeji ( Ekimae ), ( South side of the JR train station ). The Nikko Himeji (along with a few other hotels) is on the side of the JR station opposite the castle. There is now a convenient central underpass in the station with a number of shops, linking the castle- and the sea-sides of the city (previously, to get over the tracks meant either a long walk or the purchasing of a train ticket!). The Hotel Nikko is a pleasant hotel for the business traveler (although possibly pricey for those on a budget - about \xc2\xa512,000 as of 10/2008). \xc2\xa0 edit Floral Inn , \xe3\x80\x92670-0965\xe3\x80\x80\xe5\x85\xb5\xe5\xba\xab\xe7\x9c\x8c\xe5\xa7\xab\xe8\xb7\xaf\xe5\xb8\x82\xe6\x9d\xb1\xe5\xbb\xb6\xe6\x9c\xab3\xe4\xb8\x81\xe7\x9b\xae56\xe7\x95\xaa\xe5\x9c\xb0 ( About five minutes walk south of the station ), \xe2\x98\x8e 079-222-8000 , [8] . Ok standard on the rooms, although the walls separating them are a bit thin. Breakfast for \xc2\xa5500. Single room for \xc2\xa56000. Internet included (both cable and wifi) \xc2\xa56000 . \xc2\xa0 edit There is one budget guesthouse that recently opened downtown: Himeji 588 Guesthouse , \xe5\x85\xb5\xe5\xba\xab\xe7\x9c\x8c\xe5\xa7\xab\xe8\xb7\xaf\xe5\xb8\x82\xe6\x9c\xac\xe7\x94\xba\xef\xbc\x96\xef\xbc\x98\xe7\x95\xaa\xe5\x9c\xb0 ( Located near the Egret Center on the Miyuki-Dori shopping arcade ), \xe2\x98\x8e 079-283-2588 , [9] . Traditional tatami rooms with futon and a shared bathroom and common space. The first floor has a small cafe that serves free coffee and tea. WiFi, bike rental and laundry services are available. Dormitory: \xc2\xa52700 (private rooms also available) . \xc2\xa0 edit [ edit ] Get out To see Himeji Castle\'s evil twin, the brooding black Crow Castle , hop on a train 50 kilometers west to Okayama . In Okayama , you\'ll also find the lovely Korakuen Garden , one of Japan\'s Top 3 gardens. Kurashiki , only a short distance further from Okayama , is famous for its large Bikan Historic District with many well-preserved building from the Edo Period, as well as the famous Ohara Museum of Art which contains a large amount of works by the most famous European artists. Tsuyama , a quiet town with rich history, is famous for Kakuzan Park , a great place for cherry blossom viewing, Joto Street , and the beautiful Shurakuen Garden . For those interested in Japanese sword making or pottery, Bizen features museums that display its rich history.

To the East, one can easily visit the port city of Kobe , with the scenic Harborland and Meriken Park around the port. The city is also the location of the devastating Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, and visitors can go to the Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake Memorial Museum to learn more about the earthquake and how the city dealt with it. For those interested in the performing arts, the city of Takarazuka is home to Japan\'s all-female theater troupe, the Takarazuka Revue . The plays are well-done and the actresses are so convincing, you may forget that the male characters are not really men. The city also home to the Osamu Tezuka Manga Museum , which features works from all of his most famous manga. 30 min north of Himeji, on the Bantan line train, is the small town of Fukusaki . The birthplace of famous author Kunio Yanagita; Fukusaki boasts many great restaurants, small shrines and shops, in a relaxed rural setting.

The term was created by British military strategists in the 19th century, and definitions of the Middle East vary; it is not simply a geographical term, but also a political one, connoting that it separates Europe ("the West") from the Far East, and the traditional trade route of choice between these two extremes. [ edit ] Countries and territories Map of the Middle East Bahrain Iran Iraq Israel Jordan Kuwait Lebanon Oman Palestinian Territories Qatar Saudi Arabia Syria Turkey United Arab Emirates Yemen Egypt is often considered a part of the Middle East, as the Sinai is geologically a part of Asia . Sometimes Azerbaijan is considered a part of the Middle East, as a sort of border region between Europe and Asia . Even the inclusion of Iran is to a degree controversial\xe2\x80\x94it can also be considered to be a Central Asian or South Asian nation.

Ethnically, the region is extremely mixed. Arabs, Jewish people, Persians and Turks are the largest groups, but there are several substantial minorities \xe2\x80\x94 Kurds, Armenians and others \xe2\x80\x94 with their own languages, customs and sometimes their own countries. Every invading army \xe2\x80\x94 from Alexander and the Romans through Genghis Khan to the 19th century colonial powers \xe2\x80\x94 has left descendants behind. There are also substantial numbers of workers from other countries coming to the region for higher pay \xe2\x80\x94 mainly Afghan, Pakistani for jobs like construction labourer, with Egyptians, Filipinos, more Pakistanis, and some westerners in the more skilled jobs. Almost every country in the Middle East has a Muslim majority (with the notable exception of Israel which has a Jewish majority), with Iran , Iraq and Bahrain mainly Shia, other areas mainly Sunni, and both with minorities of the other \xe2\x80\x94 and the legal systems in most of these countries are influenced by Islamic Law; a few are entirely based on it. [ edit ] Cultural geography North Africa is similar to the Middle East in many ways \xe2\x80\x94 language, religion, culture and some ethnic groups. Some writers include Egypt , or even Sudan and Libya , in their use of the term "Middle East". On the other side, Central Asia also has much in common with the Middle East. Ethnic groups and languages are different, but the religion, much of the food, clothing, and architecture are similar. Iran could be counted as part of either region; at one point most of Central Asia was part of the Persian Empire. The border between southeastern Europe and the Middle East is also unclear. Many writers include Turkey in their usage of "Middle East" and we include it above, but parts of Turkey are very much European. Large parts of Turkey and all of Lebanon and Israel are also clearly Mediterranean regions. On the other hand, several countries usually considered European \xe2\x80\x94 Greece , Cyprus and to some extent the Balkans \xe2\x80\x94 also have Middle Eastern aspects to their culture. [ edit ] Get in [ edit ] By plane The largest hub for flights in the region is Dubai , from where you can reach virtually any point in the Middle East. After Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi also have good intercontinental connections. Tel Aviv is served by flights from most Western countries, though due to the political situation, it is not possible to fly from there to anywhere in the Middle East besides Egypt and Jordan. However, there are direct flights from large European hubs to most major cities in the region. [ edit ] By boat See Ferries in the Mediterranean . [ edit ] Get around Public transport is poor compared to other regions of the world including other parts of Asia. The majority of locals would use plane or car travel to get between countries. [ edit ] By plane [ edit ] By car Should you wish to enter Bahrain on land, the only way is via the King Fahd Causeway which extends from Saudi Arabia into Bahrain. Bear in mind that while Bahrain issues visas on arrival, provisions for this in Saudi Arabia are not available to non Gulf nation passport holders. [ edit ] By train Rail travel in the Middle East is limited and whilst most countries have limited passenger services between cities, there is very little between countries. Istanbul is the best starting point for rail journeys to a lot of areas in the Middle East. From here, a service to Aleppo in Syria operates from which one can take a connecting service to Damascus . There is a train that connects Damascus with Amman in Jordan. A service from Istanbul also operates to Tehran which includes a 4 hour ferry journey across Lake Van. In general, these trains tend to operate weekly or at most bi weekly. All other countries in this region have no international rail services. [ edit ] By bus This is a more practical option than trains in the Middle East as they are less prone to delays and breakdowns and have far more extensive coverage of the region. [ edit ] Talk Arabic is the primary language of the region, and the main language in all Middle Eastern countries except Iran (where Persian predominates), Turkey ( Turkish ) and Israel ( Hebrew ). Even in those countries, Arabic is fairly common as a second language; in Israel, Arabic is a second official language. Yiddish , Ladino , Kurdish , Azeri , Armenian and several other languages are also spoken in some regions. English is moderately common in tourist areas and generally rare elsewhere. In Turkey, some German is spoken because many Turks work in Germany and Austria. [ edit ][ add listing ] See High-rises made of mud in Shibam , Yemen \xe2\x80\x94"Manhattan of the Desert" [ edit ] Itineraries From Istanbul to Cairo classic overland route Hajj \xe2\x80\x94 the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina Ferries across the Red Sea [ edit ][ add listing ] Do [ edit ] Learn [ edit ][ add listing ] Buy Iranian (Also known as Persian) Carpet Iranian Pistachio Iranian Saffron Iranian Caviar [ edit ][ add listing ] Eat A fancy Arabic mixed grill. Clockwise from top: lamb kofta , chicken shish tawuk , beef shish kebab , rozz (Arabic rice), vegetables. Cookery provides obvious evidence of the extent of Middle Eastern influence. Turkish doner kebab , Greek gyros and the shawarma of the Arab countries (everywhere from Oman to Morocco) are all basically the same dish. A traveller going overland from Europe to India will find very similar dishes \xe2\x80\x94 notably flat breads and kebabs \xe2\x80\x94 in every country from Greece to India. These are also seen in Central Asia and even China . Many Greek dishes are closer to Iranian cooking than to Italian.also you can eat Iranian (Persian) great foods like\xc2\xa0: Ghorme Sabzi or Dizi [ edit ][ add listing ] Drink [ edit ][ add listing ] Sleep [ edit ] Stay safe Planning a visit to the Middle East can be complicated in various ways: Some countries and territories in the area, such as Iraq , Syria , and the Gaza Strip , are in a state of war or civil war and should not be visited. See War zone safety if you must go. Some countries, such as Saudi Arabia , do not issue tourist visas except for a few expensive tours. Some countries in the region have very strict Islamic Law, with heavy penalties for homosexuality , adultery and other "offenses". Many countries in the region do not recognize the state of Israel for many reasons. These nations may refuse you entry if you have an Israeli visa or an Israeli stamp in your passport, or even a visa for another country that was issued in Israel. The Israeli authorities will generally help you avoid these problems by providing a visa as a separate document so it is not in your passport, however now this has been discontinued; see the Israel article for details. Only Turkey , Egypt and Jordan have official relations with Israel in the region. For most of the area, suggestions in Tips for travel in developing countries apply. [ edit ] Stay healthy [ edit ] Contact [ edit ] Get out Turkey and Cyprus \xe2\x80\x94 with lots of border posts and extensive transportation alternatives, southern Turkey is well linked to Syria . It may also be possible to take cruises to the island nation of Cyprus from Syria as well as Lebanon . Egypt \xe2\x80\x94 with buses from Israel and ferries from Jordan , Egypt is an easy trip from the region. South Asia \xe2\x80\x94 the "Hippie Trail" , after traversing Turkey and Iran from one end to another (and dipping into Iraq at a time in history) goes onward to Pakistan . Central Asia \xe2\x80\x94 an off the beaten path destination, which is accessible by buses from the Iranian city of Mashhad (which terminate in Turkmenistan and Afghanistan ). Caucasus \xe2\x80\x94 the lush and beautiful Caucasus is a short hop north from Iran. This article is an outline and needs more content.

S'North America travel guide - Wikitravel Help Wikitravel grow by contributing to an article! Learn how . North America From Wikitravel Jump to: navigation , search Contents [+] Countries and continental sections Territories Cities Other destinations Understand Get in [+] Get around By air By bus By car By train Talk [+] See Itineraries Do Buy Eat Drink Sleep Stay safe Stay healthy Contact North America is a part of the continent named America, after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci, with a surface area of 24,221,490 sq km (9,351,969 sq mi). It is located in the northern hemisphere, between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean and to the north of South America . North America\'s highest point is Alaska\'s Mount McKinley, which rises to 6,194 m (20,320 ft) above sea level. [ edit ] Countries and continental sections North America consists of three large nations and one large island territory that covers most of its area. They are Canada , the United States of America (USA), Mexico and Greenland . There are also seven smaller nations at its southern extreme (collectively known as Central America ), around two dozen island nations and territories of various sizes in the Caribbean , and one isolated French territory off the Canadian Atlantic coast. Although the Central American and the Caribbean regions are technically part of the North American continent, they are commonly listed separately from their larger neighbors to the north and hence the distinctive region names for both cultural and geographical reasons. Regions of North America Canada The Great White North certainly has vast expanses of unspoiled wilderness, but it also features some of the world\'s most modern, cosmopolitan cities. Caribbean White sandy beaches, crystal-clear water, and laid-back island culture make the Caribbean one of the world\'s top vacation spots. Central America The seven nations of this isthmus connecting North and South America blend elements of both continents; you\'ll find bustling cities, ancient jungle ruins, and Spanish-tinged mestizo and Afro-Indian cultures. Greenland A self-governing country, but officially still part of Denmark , Greenland is a vast island of stark landscapes and midnight sun. Mexico Mexico is a big tourist attraction for sun-seekers and historians alike; the former flock to Mexico\'s tropical beaches, while the latter find the artifacts of the ancient Aztec and Mayan civilization fascinating. United States of America One of the largest, most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations on Earth includes some of the world\'s most famous cities, natural parks of unspeakable beauty, and virtually everything in between. [ edit ] Territories Bermuda \xe2\x80\x94 overseas territory of the United Kingdom Saint-Pierre and Miquelon \xe2\x80\x94 overseas department of France [ edit ] Cities Havana \xe2\x80\x94 the capital of Cuba is famous for its cigars, its strong Hispanic-Caribbean culture, and its legendary nightlife Kingston \xe2\x80\x94 the center of Afro-Caribbean culture, it is cosmopolitan, diverse and the Home of Reggae. Los Angeles \xe2\x80\x94 Hollywood and movie stars; mountains and beaches; and lots of traffic Mexico City \xe2\x80\x94 the third-largest city in the world is chock-full of museums, centuries-old architecture, modern amenities... and people New York City \xe2\x80\x94 the Big Apple is the center of North American commerce and culture, immortalized in film and song alike Panama City \xe2\x80\x94 a friendly city sitting at the nexus between two continents Toronto \xe2\x80\x94 Canada\'s largest city, a cosmopolitan melting pot with ethnic enclaves and cultural attractions galore Vancouver \xe2\x80\x94 a city of steel and glass condominiums and outstanding natural beauty, where you can go skiing and sit on the beach all in the same day Washington, D.C. \xe2\x80\x94 the capital of the United States, with cultural and historical attractions aplenty [ edit ] Other destinations Banff National Park Chichen Itza Corcovado National Park Grand Canyon Niagara Falls Teotihuacan Tikal Walt Disney World Yellowstone National Park [ edit ] Understand [ edit ] Get in [ edit ] Get around [ edit ] By air Because population centers are often widely spaced, most long-range travel is by air, with an extensive network of major hubs and smaller regional airports, usually supplemented with car rental services to cover local travel (see "By car"). [ edit ] By bus There is prolific long range bus service across most of the US and Canada, but travel times are excessively long (on the order of three to five times as long as a direct trip in a personal vehicle) and many stations are relatively unsafe. Most bus service is useful only for traveling within a dense metro area or along major commuter routes and is then limited or unavailable outside of business hours. [ edit ] By car Most travel in Canada, the United States, and Mexico is by personal vehicle. Almost all highways in Canada and the United States are well maintained, with amenities such as gas, food, and lodging ranging from adequate to very convenient to excessive. If you experience an emergency that endangers your life, safety, or property, you will be able to dial 911 from a compatible cell phone on almost any major highway and reach an operator at any time. Vehicle and medical insurance issued in either Canada or the U.S. is usually valid in the other, though the wise traveler will confirm with their insurer. Canada and U.S. insurance coverage in Mexico is sometimes limited or not honored. Again, the wise traveler will confirm with their insurer. Car rental agencies are available at almost every airport. Usually a major credit card and proof of liability insurance is required. Some agencies offer short term insurance and additional coverage. [ edit ] By train Although it once held much of the continent together, and remains useful for local travel in many metro areas, intercity train travel now ranges from relatively convenient in the Northeast Corridor, to manageable in California and parts of southeastern Canada, to sparse in other parts of the continent. If you prefer to travel by rail, it\'s still possible (depending on where you go), but it offers neither speed nor convenience. As noted above, the exception is the Northeast Corridor area, which links Washington, D.C. to Boston with frequent stops in intermediate cities such as Baltimore , Philadelphia , New York City , New Haven , and Providence . It is explained in detail on the Rail travel in North America article. [ edit ] Talk The United States and the majority of Canada are majority English speaking countries and is by far the best language for getting around these vast countries. English is also spoken in many Caribbean nations and the small country of Belize. Mexico and the majority of Central America and portions of the Caribbean are majority Spanish speaking making it an important North American language as well. Spanish is spoken as a second language in many parts of the United States. French plays a substantial role in Canada, (including Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, and New Brunswick), and a key role in other places, namely the Caribbean. Dutch is spoken in the southern Caribbean. Several indigenous languages are spoken by Native Americans and the Inuit peoples of North America including in Greenland, Alaska and Nunavut. Danish is also spoken in Greenland. Other important immigrant languages spoken in many ethnic neighborhoods of North America are Cantonese, Mandarin, and Tagalog. German is still spoken in rural communities of the Amish. The three major languages of North America are English, Spanish and French.

Oceania From Wikitravel Jump to: navigation , search Contents Regions Cities Other destinations [+] Understand European influence Common cultural heritage Ecology [+] Get in By plane By boat [+] Get around By plane By ship See [+] Do In the water On land Eat Drink Stay safe Stay healthy Oceania is a vast, arbitrarily defined expanse of the world where the Pacific Ocean \xe2\x80\x93 rather than land borders \xe2\x80\x93 connects the nations. It is home to glistening white beaches, coconut palms swaying in the breeze, beautiful coral reefs, and rugged volcanic islands rising out of the blue ocean. Its diverse nations have both some of the world\'s most cosmopolitan and internationalised cities such as Melbourne , and some of its most remote and culturally isolated villages. [ edit ] Regions Australia , New Zealand and Papua New Guinea are by far the largest countries in this continent with the first two the most visited. Oceania also includes the vast island nation groupings of Polynesia to the far east, Melanesia in the west and Micronesia to the north. Australia By far the largest and most populous country in Oceania. New Zealand A major destination, with well-developed facilities for travellers. Technically part of Polynesia as the indigenous Maori are Polynesian and providing the major air hub to the rest of Polynesia Papua New Guinea Tropical rainforest, great scenery and culture. An adventurous, rarely visited, travel destination. Polynesia No other name quite conjures up images of paradise like this one. Stunning paradisical islands sprawling for thousands of miles across the remote South Pacific. Melanesia Closely related to the ethno-cultural makeup of the oft-included Papua New Guinea, Melanesia is home to the always popular destination of Fiji . Micronesia The tiny Micronesian islands fall on or north of the Equator, and see less tourist and business travel than the rest of the island groupings. If looking for a really pretty destination, aim for Palau .

At one time it was envisaged that the two colonies would become a single country. Papua New Guinea was, at one time, a United Nations trusteeship, administered by Australia. Various islands have been annexed by Britain, Spain, Portugal, Germany, France, Australia and the United States. This has had an influence on the aspects of culture. Many areas speak both an indigenous language, and the language of the colonial power, often mixing in interesting blends. There has also been an influence on the food and architecture. [ edit ] Common cultural heritage [ edit ] Ecology Ecologically, Oceania also includes the eastern parts of Indonesia as far as Lombok and Sulawesi . [ edit ] Get in [ edit ] By plane Crystal blue sea off the coast of Samoa . See the country articles for detailed information on how to Get in . The major countries of Australia and New Zealand do of course offer connections from all continents, although there are few direct flights from South America. There are some other gateways offering other opportunities to get in to Oceania, and for interesting itineraries. Air France connects New Caledonia direct with Tokyo and Paris and also flies to Tahiti . Onward connections to Sydney and Auckland are possible. Air Pacific connects Fiji with Los Angeles with connections through to Sydney , Auckland and Tahiti . Tahiti is connected to Los Angeles , and you can fly to the Cook Islands direct from there. Air New Zealand provides a service to Tonga and Samoa from Los Angeles and Auckland. The Los Angeles service is subsidized by the New Zealand government as a form of aid to the the two countries. Manila , Guam and Honolulu offer a gateway to many countries of Micronesia, mainly on Continental Airlines. The smallest islands with less tourism present additional challenges to get to. Many are entirely deserted, and some have restictions on access. [ edit ] By boat A South Pacific cruise. [ edit ] Get around [ edit ] By plane Without a yacht, or a lot of time, the only way for travellers to get around between the main destinations of Oceania is by plane. Sydney , Brisbane , Auckland , and Los Angeles have good connectivity to the region. It is usually possible to fly from the west coast of the United States through to Sydney or Auckland via Hawaii , Tahiti , Fiji or even the Cook Islands . However, air routes tend to come and go depending on whether the airlines find them profitable or not. Much of Micronesia, having been under US Administration, is serviced by Continental Airlines. Much of English-speaking Polynesia receives regular flights from Air New Zealand. Melanesia is mainly serviced by national and Australian airlines. Don\'t expect daily flights. Patience is required. Flying between Micronesia and the other two areas is problematic and may involve flying all the way to Honolulu or a complicated route through Manila, Sydney and Auckland. Continental Airlines has (January 2011) a weekly flight from Guam to Nadi in Fiji . Some flight options within Oceania, amongst others, are: Guam has connections through to the United States , Japan , and a usually very expensive connection to Cairns in Far North Queensland and to Fiji . Cook Islands has connections to Tahiti . Tahiti has flights to Auckland . Fiji has connections to Tahiti , Solomon Islands , Samoa , Guam , Tuvalu , Kiribati and Vanuatu . Solomon Islands has connections through to Fiji and Vanuatu . Vanuatu has connections through to Fiji and New Caledonia . New Caledonia has flights to Auckland . The Tonga , Samoa and Fiji triangle is fairly well connected, although there is only one flight a week each way between Samoa and Tonga at present. [ edit ] By ship There are some options for boats, cruise ships, private yachts, adventure cruises, and even cargo ships. Consult the guide for the destination you are visiting. [ edit ][ add listing ] See Neiafu harbour, Vava\'u , in Tonga All island groups are fascinating and with time and money you can spend months just travelling around. There are some stunningly beautiful islands ( Samoa , Cook Islands , French Polynesia ), some fascinating cultures and festivals, some wonderful diving and totally deserted beaches. Check the individual country sections for details. [ edit ][ add listing ] Do [ edit ] In the water Coral and Tropical Fish . There are locations for diving throughout Oceania , for coral and tropical fish, explore the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland , the Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia , Fiji has some reef around Nadi , and specular unspoilt brightly coloured coral on the more remote islands. Samoa is favoured by scuba divers. Cook Islands has accessible reef just off the beach on the main islands. Vanuatu has accessible some accessible reef too, but the facilities there make it more challenging to access than Fiji . Sail. Vava\'u in Tonga is a popular destination for yachts crossing the Pacific. Yachts can also be chartered there. Sub-tropical diving - Diving and snorkelling opportunities still exist even without a tropical reef. Tasmania has some diving spots. [ edit ] On land Skiing and snow sports . New Zealand has reliable winter snowfalls, mostly on the South Island in winter. The Snowy Mountains in New South Wales have the largest ski resorts in the southern hemisphere. [ edit ][ add listing ] Eat Although staple foods from outside the region, such as rice and flour, now have a firm foothold, the traditional staples of roots and tubers remain very important. The cheapest is usually cassava, which also plays a food security role as it can be left in the ground for a long time. Sweet potato is a very important crop and is found in most parts of Oceania with the major producing area being the Higlands of Papua New Guinea . Taro and yam are also widespread. The latter is the most valuable of the roots and tubers and there are many customs associated with its cultivation. In the Sepik area of Papua New Guinea, for example, sex between married couples is supposed to be forbidden while the yams are growing. On the other hand, in the Trobriand Islands the yam harvest is a period of sexual liberty. [ edit ][ add listing ] Drink Kava is a drink produced from the roots of a plant related to the pepper plant and found mainly in Polynesia as well as Fiji and Vanuatu. It has a mildly narcotic effect. Other names include \'awa (Hawai\'i), \'ava (Samoa), yaqona (Fiji), and sakau ( Pohnpei ). Traditionally it is prepared by chewing, grinding or pounding the roots of the kava plant. In Tonga, chewing traditionally had to be done by female virgins. Pounding is done in a large stone with a small log. The product is then added to cold water and consumed as quickly as possible, invariably as part of a group of people sitting around and sharing the cup. Check the rules before taking any out of the country, however, as importing kava can be illegal. [ edit ] Stay safe [ edit ] Stay healthy Vanuatu , Solomon Islands , Papua New Guinea all have malaria risk in parts. Fiji , New Caledonia , the Cook Islands , Samoa and the other islands are malaria free. The islands may be remote but sexual diseases know no boundaries. Usual precautions apply. This is a usable article. It gives a good overview of the region, its sights, and how to get in, as well as links to the main destinations, whose articles are similarly well developed.

S'South America travel guide - Wikitravel Help Wikitravel grow by contributing to an article! Learn how . South America From Wikitravel Jump to: navigation , search Contents Countries and territories Cities Other destinations Understand [+] Get in By plane By car By train By boat [+] Get around Visas By plane By train By bus Talk See Do Buy Eat Drink Sleep Stay safe Stay healthy Contact Machu Picchu in Peru Nestled between the Caribbean, the South Pacific, and the South Atlantic Oceans, South America is the wilder of the Americas and a continent of superlatives. The world\'s biggest rainforest and the largest river (Amazon), the highest mountain range outside Asia (the Andes), remote islands ( Galapagos Islands , Easter Island and Fernando de Noronha ), heavenly beaches (such as in Brazil\'s Northeastern region), wide deserts (Atacama), icy landscapes ( Patagonia & Tierra del Fuego ), the world\'s tallest waterfall (the 979m Angel Falls , in Venezuela) and one of the largest ( Igua\xc3\xa7u Falls , Argentina and Brazil), as well as several other breathtaking natural attractions. Besides, the work of man has also left rare gems on the continent: ruins of ancient civilizations ( Machu Picchu and other Inca cities; the Moais in Easter Island) share the continent with world-class metropolises ( S\xc3\xa3o Paulo , Buenos Aires , Bogot\xc3\xa1 , Caracas , Santiago , Lima and Rio de Janeiro ), outstanding modern architecture ( Brasilia ), European architecture ( Buenos Aires ), the oldest rock paintings in the Americas (at the Serra da Capivara ), strong African heritage (in Salvador , Rio and Montevideo), genuine indigenous ( Bel\xc3\xa9m , Manaus , Cuzco , Lima , La Paz ), charming cities built in the Andes ( Caracas , Medell\xc3\xadn , Quito , Santiago de Chile ) and Eastern culture (S\xc3\xa3o Paulo\'s enormous Japanese community), mingled with the fingerprints of Iberian colonizers. Ushuaia , the world\'s southernmost city and some of its biggest festivities, such as Rio\'s Carnival and Belem\'s Cirio de Nazar\xc3\xa9 , the Tango World Championship, and the Vendimia festival in Argentina, are also part of this incredibly diverse and attractive continent.

Although some particular places are still quite hard to reach (i.e. Paraguay , Suriname , northern Brazil ), the places that you most likely want to go, such as Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro , are more accessible than ever before. From Africa : the only (reliable) options worth considering would be the South African Airways service linking Johannesburg with Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires or the Malaysian Airlines service between both major South African cities and Argentina( Johannesburg via Cape Town to Buenos Aires ). There are also connections between Luanda and Rio de Janeiro, Salvador de Bahia and Recife with Taag Angola Airlines. Do realize that demand between Africa and South America is very limited, so even the aforementioned services are infrequent and fares may be quite high. From Asia : Be prepared for a very long journey, especially if your itinerary includes connecting flights to travel to/beyond the major Asian and South American hubs. There is a Korean Air route between Seoul -Incheon and Sao Paulo (via Los Angeles ). Do note that the Malaysian Airlines flight makes 2 stops en route, while the latter options involve a stop in the United States that will require all passengers, including those in transit, to pass through U.S. customs. Air China has flights between Beijing and S\xc3\xa3o Paulo , via Madrid . Emirates has non-stop flights from Dubai to Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro , this latter continuing services to Buenos Aires . In 2011, Singapore Airlines started flights from Singapore to Sao Paulo via Barcelona . In 2012 Qatar Airways started its daily non-stop service from Doha to S\xc3\xa3o Paulo , continuing services to Buenos Aires . From Australia, New Zealand , and the South Pacific : A somewhat surprising number of options exist. Both Aerolineas Argentinas and LAN Airlines serve Auckland and Sydney from their respective hubs at Buenos Aires and Santiago , while Qantas introduced a non-stop service between Sydney and Santiago on March 2012. LAN also operates one of the world\'s most obscure flights of all - a service linking Santiago - Easter Island - Tahiti . From Perth Emirates provides affordable flights to Buenos Aires with a stopover in Dubai, around 30 hours total flying time. From Europe : The entire South American continent once lived under European colonial rule, and the resultant political, social, and economic ties between former colonies and colonizers remain quite strong even today. Portuguese flag carrier TAP Airlines is by far the leading foreign carrier to Brazil, serving a slew of destinations in North and East Brazil , including direct connections from Lisbon to Porto Alegre in South Brazil and to the Brazilian capital Brasilia which otherwise have few other internattional connections. Spanish flag carrier Iberia flies to most of the former Spanish colonies, although neither Bolivia nor Paraguay are served. KLM flies between Amsterdam and Suriname and Air France links Paris with French Guiana . Of course, such services are not exclusive - KLM also flies to Lima , TAP to Caracas , Air France to Rio de Janeiro and Lima , etc. Other leading European airlines such as British Airways, Lufthansa, Swiss Airlines, and Alitalia also serve key South American gateways from their respective hubs, while South American airlines also operate into several major European cities as well. From North America : Until very recently, it was virtually inconceivable to reach South America from anywhere other than Miami . Today, however, rapidly developing hubs at Atlanta , Dallas / Fort Worth , Fort Lauderdale , Houston , Mexico City , New York , Newark , Orlando , Toronto , and Washington -Dulles offer viable alternatives. Indeed, airlines such as Air Canada, United and Delta Airlines have successfully begun to challenge the virtual monopoly once enjoyed by American Airlines to several key markets. American discount carriers such as Spirit Airlines and JetBlue (Azul in Brazil) have recently fought hard for and won several route authorities to serve the likes of Colombia , Brazil and Peru , bringing low fares to these markets for the first time. Recently, US Airways started a daily non-stop service from Charlotte to Rio de Janeiro . Given the U.S. airlines\' cutbacks in service, frequency, and cities served over the years, consider high quality Latin American carriers such as Avianca (to Colombia with daily non-stop flights to Bogot\xc3\xa1, Medell\xc3\xadn , Cali and Cartagena), Copa Airlines (Panama\'s national airline to hits hub in Panam\xc3\xa1 City), LAN Airlines (Chilean carrier serving Chile direct and via several other countries), or TAM (to Brazil, including some non-stop flights to other brazilian cities besides [S\xc3\xa3o Paulo]] and Rio de Janeiro , like Belo Horizonte , Brasilia and Manaus ). [ edit ] By car Beware there are no roads connecting Panama with Colombia, hence it is not possible to drive from Central America. People overcome this problem shipping their cars from Colon (Atlantic side in Panama) to Cartagena or Barranquilla (Colombia), or from Panama City (Pacific side of the Panama canal) to Buenaventura (Colombia) or Guayaquil (Ecuador). The Pan-American Highway is a series of routes starting in Central America and running to the tip of South America (save for the aforementioned gap between Panama and Colombia). It\'s an interesting option for those with a good vehicle, plenty of spare parts, and a desire to explore the western edge of the continent. [ edit ] By train There are no railroads between Panama and Colombia. [ edit ] By boat Some cruise liners cover the towns in the lower Caribbean (Cartagena, Santa Marta, Margarita Island). Royal Caribbean [1] , Holland America [2] , Princess Cruises [3] . [ edit ] Get around [ edit ] Visas The Union of South American Nations gives visa-free access and a customs union between all countries in South America. [ edit ] By plane [ edit ] By train There are no cross-country train services in South America, and with the exception of Argentina and Chile , domestic networks are quite limited. There are a number of very scenic "tourist trains" though, including the 445-km Quito - Guayaquil route in Ecuador . [ edit ] By bus Buses are the main form of land transportation for much of the continent... for longer distances you\'re often better off flying. [ edit ] Talk Spanish is the official language in all countries except Brazil, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana, and is widely spoken even in the countries that are not historically Spanish speaking. Portuguese is the official language in Brazil , which comprises about half the population and land area of the continent. Anyway, Spanish and Portuguese are such close languages that fluency in any of these will allow you to travel within the entire continent. There are also many indigenous tribes living in South America who speak their own languages, and if you are really going off the beaten track, you might have to learn them too. In Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana, the official languages are English , Dutch and French respectively. [ edit ][ add listing ] See [ edit ][ add listing ] Do International Charter Group: [4] - [5] . Yacht charter and sailing, one of the worlds largest acht charter companies, can take care of all charter requirements, from bareboat to crewed in the South America. Operating from nine offices worldwide (USA, Spain, UK, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Switzerland, Caribbean, Honk Kong and Dubai). [ edit ][ add listing ] Buy [ edit ][ add listing ] Eat what you want [ edit ][ add listing ] Drink [ edit ][ add listing ] Sleep [ edit ] Stay safe Wearing or carrying items which may identify you as an affluent tourist can be a mistake. You shouldn\'t pack anything that you would be upset to lose. Leave expensive jewelry, watches and other items of value at home and only carry what you need. That goes for credit cards and other documents as well; if you have no need for them leave them behind in the hotel safe, only take what money you are likely to spend with you. [ edit ] Stay healthy Tap water in many countries is not drinkable, it\'s wise to purify your own or buy bottled water. Malaria and Yellow fever can be a risk as well on the continent, check with a travel clinic or your doctor before heading out to see if you\'ll be in a high-risk area.

S'Wikitravel:About - Wikitravel Help Wikitravel grow by contributing to an article! Learn how . Wikitravel:About From Wikitravel Jump to: navigation , search Wikitravel ( http://wikitravel.org ) is a project to create a free , complete, up-to-date and reliable world-wide travel guide . It is built in collaboration by Wikitravellers from around the globe. Wikitravel is built with the spirit of sharing knowledge that makes travel so enjoyable. Whenever travellers meet each other on the road, they swap info about the places they came from and ask questions about places they\'re going. We want to make it easy to share that knowledge and let others share it; our copyleft license means that the facts you know can spread far and wide. The project was begun in July of 2003 by the two founders, Evan and Maj . It was inspired by Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia, and by the needs of travellers for timely information that long book-publishing cycles can\'t seem to meet. In April 2006, Wikitravel was acquired by Internet Brands, Inc., an operator of consumer information Web sites. To create Wikitravel we use a tool (or a process, or a technology) called Wiki which lets any Internet reader create , update, edit , and illustrate any article on the Web site. We all share our pieces of knowledge, edit them, distill them, and assemble them into a pleasing and cohesive whole. The more people that use the Edit link, the better Wikitravel becomes. We\'ve achieved some milestones , but we still have a long way to go. If you\'re new to Wikitravel , feel free to plunge forward and help us ! The Wikitravel universe also includes Wikitravel Shared \xe2\x80\x94 Wikitravel\'s image repository and cross-language coordination site (bugs, feature requests, language versions, etc).

Wikitravel:Quick contribution guide From Wikitravel Jump to: navigation , search Contents How to? Avoid Moving forward See also Wikitravel is the first complete, up-to-date and reliable world-wide travel guide . It is built in collaboration by Wikitravellers from around the globe, and your contributions will be seen by 7 Million travelers every month! You can make a valuable contribution to Wikitravel in just minutes. For information on how your contributions are licensed, read copyleft . How to? Add Listing Feature Add Listing Box 1. Add a listing . Articles on Wikitravel have different Sections: See , Do , Buy , Eat , Drink , Sleep . Right next to each section there is an option to Add Listing. Simply click on it and "Add New Listing" box will show up. Fill out the sections following our guidelines and click on Save . In this way you have contributed to Wikitravel and helped other Travelers! What to add . Choose any attraction, park, view, bar, pub or restaurant that you are enthusiastic about and would like to share information about. It should be somewhere you know and have visited, but it really doesn\'t matter if you have been there while travelling, or if it is in your local area. You don\'t have to be an expert. Your experience and perspective is valuable to others like you. How to describe it . Decide what type of person would like to visit, and what are the features that would make them want to visit. Everybody has different interests, from birdwatching to adventure sports, from quiet country pub to the latest urban beats. Help travellers find what they like. If you like it, what are your interests that make you like it? If you know the best way to get there, or the best time to experience it, add that too. Don\'t use I , me ,, us , or we in the description. Don\'t hesitate to use you , though, when addressing the reader. Edit a page 2. Edit a page . You can edit any article on Wikitravel simply by clicking "Edit" link. You will see the text formatted in Wiki markup . It helps the rest of us if you follow our policies and guidelines and manual of style . However, even more important than following every guideline is to plunge forward and write something \xe2\x80\x93 someone will be along to help with the formatting later! Add your hometown, or a place you\xe2\x80\x99ve visited often! Find the right article . Wikitravel articles are named after the geographical location. Select the best article based on where the attraction is. If it is outside of a town, you might have to place it where travellers would normally stay when visiting it. Find the right section . See for sights. Do for activities. Drink for nightlife, pubs and bars, Eat for restaurants, cafes, and fast food. More in Where you can stick it and standard article sections guide . How to describe it . Decide what type of person would like to visit, and what are the features that would make them want to visit. Everybody has different interests, from birdwatching to adventure sports, from quiet country pub to the latest urban beats. Help travellers find what they like. If you like it, what are your interests that make you like it? If you know the best way to get there, or the best time to experience it, add that too. Don\'t use I , me ,, us , or we in the description. Don\'t hesitate to use you , though, when addressing the reader. 3. Create a page . sometimes the destination you would like to describe or add an attraction to doesn\'t exist. Plunge forward and start an article. Check that the page you want does not already exist, or that the information doesn\'t already exist on another page. Do a search for the name of your proposed new page, and see what is returned. When creating a new page, you will be asked to choose the right template. New pages can be created for cities, towns, national parks, and regions ; for travel topics (including phrasebooks ); and for itineraries . Please do not create new articles for hotels, restaurants or attractions; they should be listed in existing destination articles instead. See What is an article? for details. 4. Register an Account . Anybody can make contributions to Wikitravel, but creating an account will give you various benefits : Write on User Talk pages to communicate with other writers about your edits and travel tips. Ability to turn off advertising in your Account Settings. Credit for your travel writing/edits, which will be attributed to you rather than just an IP address. Your contributions will be more trusted as you become familiar to other Wikitravelers. Avoid Changing section headings - even if you don\'t like them. Wikitravel uses a standard template for each article. Writing about culture . Wikitravel articles often have Respect or Understand sections, which attract extensive contributions on culture. However, your time is best spent adding practical advice and suggestions, and letting the traveller discover the culture for themselves when they get there. Writing about things you don\'t like . Don\'t waste your time on Wikitravel telling travellers about places they don\'t want to go, sharing your insight into somewhere travellers would want to go is infinitely more valuable! Encyclopaedic or promotional language . Writing that something is fantastic or the best can be meaningless to a reader who may have different interests to you. Remember to think of why you like something, and say it in the normal words you would use. Don\'t adopt the tone of a tourism board, or a neutral point of view just because you are writing in a guide. Your natural conversational tone, and your genuine interest in what you are describing is what we are hoping to capture! Moving forward If you want to get more involved, or learn more about Wikitravel you could start by reading the manual of style , and the help files which will give you an in-depth description, or by looking at some of our star articles .

A question regarding a destination article should be swept to the article discussion page A discussion regarding a policy or the subject of an expedition can be swept to the policy or expedition discussion page A simple question asked by a user can be swept to that user\'s talk page, but consider if the documentation needs a quick update to make it clearer for the next user with the same question. A pointer to a discussion going on elsewhere, such as a notice of a star nomination or or a request to comment on another talk page, can be removed when it is two months old. Any discussion that occurred in the pub can be swept to to where the main discussion took place. Any discussions that do not fall into any of these categories, and are not of any special importance for posterity, should be archived to Wikitravel:Travellers\' pub/Archives and removed from here. If you are not sure where to put a discussion, leave it alone \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s better to spend your efforts on those that you do know where to place. [ edit ] New administrators nomination We have a new nomination for the administrator on Wikitravel. Please have a look at Administrator nominations . Best, IBAlex 20:34, 3 December 2012 (EST) [ edit ] Improvement Ideas We are planning to revitalize Wikitravel and our community! In 2013 we would like to improve technicality and usability of the site and we are open to any ideas! Please let us know of any new features you would like to have on WT and share with us your suggestions on how to make Wikitravel better. Thank you! IBAlex 14:20, 20 December 2012 (EST) Please list the appropriate pages to make suggestions. -- 118.93.73.30 03:16, 2 January 2013 (EST) Please enable the API. I would love to use Wikitravel with my iPad App (Wikipanion) 217.160.127.250 06:24, 14 January 2013 (EST) Please would you list the appropriate pages to make suggestions! (I assume it can\'t be here, because few are replying here...) -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 23:20, 18 March 2013 (EDT) IBAlex : Please would you clarify ( on this actual Pub page and preferably in this topic and IN PLAIN TEXT - many people don\'t read edit summaries ) WHERE folks should make suggestions? I know this is going to come across as very snippy - but I really think it important that IBadmins should read this page at least at the beginning and end of their working shift and leave some sort of reply - even if it\'s only a holding reply (so as not to create a bad impression). If you read down, you will see that many topics are still waiting an authoritative reply, and if you are sincere about wanting to "revitalize Wikitravel and our community" this task is probably at least as important as welcoming robot spammers and then deleting their accounts... -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 18:40, 22 March 2013 (EDT) [ edit ] Policy on free-riding tips I got some second thoughts about deleting tips on how to evade a station entrance fee in Stockholm-Arlanda Airport: Link to change log What is Wikitravel\'s policy for riding transports, or entering venues, without a proper ticket? Is it a no-no, or are there circumstances when such information is allowed? / Blist 19:12, 23 December 2012 (EST) There is an Wikitravel:Illegal_activities_policy . AlasdairW 19:14, 26 December 2012 (EST) Based on the above policy I\'d say it\'s clear that info should be deleted. It could be argued as acceptable e.g. if there\'s an official requirement to pay for a ticket but everybody ignores it and it isn\'t controlled or sanctioned - falling somewhat loosely under "Where police or public corruption mean that the written law of the land differs substantially from the practise of law enforcement." Maaaybe applicable in this case if all local U-30 people do it. Berserk 23:36, 26 December 2012 (EST) Related is G\xc3\xa4vle , where I saw the need to point out that burning the G\xc3\xa4vle Goat is illegal, since the goats have been burnt down by foreign travellers, who were deceived by locals to commit the act, with legal consequences. / Blist 15:50, 27 December 2012 (EST) [ edit ] Star Articles Many articles on Wikitravel are very well developed and serve as a great source of information for many Travelers. We should nominate the best ones as Star Articles and feature them on the Main Page. I nominated Bangkok today. Please let me know what you think and if you have any other candidates. IBAlex 15:23, 14 January 2013 (EST) [ edit ] New Main Page We have updated today the Main Page and added a fully new section with Top Destinations . Right now we are featuring Top Destinations 2013 and Top Ski Destination . We would like to change this section frequently and we are open to your ideas for future top places around the world, for example: Top Beaches Top Hiking Places What are your ideas? Please let us know . Thank you! IBAlex 13:10, 18 January 2013 (EST) [ edit ] moon Interestingly, we have the option to book hotels for the moon with the orbitz booking tool. 19:12, 11 February 2013 (EST) Hi! Thanks for notifying us! I\'m afraid this option will have to be disabled soon\xc2\xa0:) Cheers! IBAlex 19:21, 11 February 2013 (EST) [ edit ] Default image sizes in Thumbnails Currently, all unregistered users (and those logged-on, registered users that have not bothered to change their preferences at My Preferences > Appearance > Thumbnail size from the default) view thumbnails at the (relatively small) default width of 180px Since this default was set 10 years ago, connection speeds have typically increased (and prices reduced) worldwide. I would, therefore, like to suggest that the default size be modestly increased to 250px and the pick selection be changed from: $wgThumbLimits = array( 120, 150, 180, 200, 250, 300 ); to: $wgThumbLimits = array( 120, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500 ); The relevant variable in LocalSettings.php on the server in which to set this range of thumbnail size options is, I think, $wgThumbLimits . (And see also in the Manual\'s FAQ, How do I change default user preferences and $wgDefaultUserOptions ].) Does anyone disagree and, if so, why? -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 01:10, 15 March 2013 (EDT) 19:10, 28 February 2013 (EST) Grrrrrrreat - it seems everyone is either asleep or in full agreement with the above proposal. IBadmins: please would you indicate how long it will take to make this change? -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 19:18, 13 March 2013 (EDT) Currently we are working on upgrading the website and we are using fully our IT resources. The upgrade is the priority. Once we accomplish that I can assure you that we will resolve the issue with "Default image sizes in Thumbnails". Thank you for your understanding! Warm regards, IBAlex 21:08, 13 March 2013 (EDT) That\'s terrific news! Can you indicate what sort of "upgrading" we can expect - or is it all top secret? I\'ll ask you again in a couple of weeks if you\'re not able to give an indication now. Thanks! -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 11:20, 13 March 2013 (EDT) [ edit ] Template:Panorama now seems to work - but use it sparingly until we sort out the image defaults above. (There may be a case for having just a tiny thumbnail on the main article pages with a link to a subpage of the main article containing any panorama images to save hassles for roaming mobile users and those on other slow/expensive connections)... -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 19:21, 7 March 2013 (EST) What image defaults would you suggest? I checked Milford Sound page and the image is too wide. Would love to fix it together with you. Cheers! IBAlex 20:07, 8 March 2013 (EST) I\'ve suggested them in the section immediately above this one. When you say "too wide", what do you mean exactly, please? Do you mean that there is no slider visible below the image window or that the image window does not size itself according to the page width or that the image window overflows the left or right hand gutters? If any of these, could you specify your operating system and browser versions and whether you have right hand advertising switched on or off in your user preferences, please? -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 22:13, 8 March 2013 (EST) Thanks for replying. I meant that the image window does not size itself according to the page width. I tried to edit the Milford Sound page and when I changed the parameters to 900px, it looked better. I understood that above you were suggesting the default image sizes in thumbnails, not panoramic images, is that right? I am using Windows 7, Mozilla Firefox and I have the ads turned on. Thank you! Warm regards, IBAlex 14:15, 11 March 2013 (EDT) How bizarre! Can you upload screenshots, please? What happens with Chrome or IE Explorer? Yes, the sub-section above is not concerned with Panorama images. However, I may have to stop trying to improve the look and feel of your pages if the spam filters keep obstructing me. It is very important that a look and feel is developed which is attractive and easy to read for unregistered users and that also allows you to keep your current width of adverts (that you depend on for monetising this site) so that your technical support and development can be financed. -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 19:00, 11 March 2013 (EDT) BUMP : I know there have been some great changes in your life recently, User:IBalex , but please can you favour me with a response to my queries above so I can move on with re-coding if necessary? -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 19:20, 13 March 2013 (EDT) That\'s how the page displays on my screen I have uploaded the picture to show you how the panorama picture displays on my computer. Right now I have to scroll to the right. Yes, I got the same results on the other browsers. I opt that we keep the panorama pic parameters in a way that it sizes itself according to the page width. If you experience problems with Abuse Filters, please let me know. Thanks! IBAlex 21:04, 13 March 2013 (EDT) Screenshot of English Wikitravel\'s Milford Sound page showing the slider of the new Panorama templated view box on a narrow screen (note the usual "enlarge" widget at the lower right hand corner and the fact that the caption text has wrapped to a second line) Unfortunately you have not taken a screenshot of your whole screen (and, more especially, your screen width ), but I have a strong suspicion that you are using a relatively wide screen (or at least one wide enough to display the whole width of the wide panorama and, therefore, you have no slider to pan left or right. What happens when you reduce the width of your tab or window and do you have an "enlarge" widget visible at the bottom right? Screenshot of same section of our Milford Sound page showing how the whole view box (when using the new Panorama template) expands to fit the whole width of the page on a wider screen (note the usual "enlarge" widget at the lower right hand corner) I am enclosing two screen-grabs of how things look on typical laptops or notebooks (as opposed to wide, desk-top monitors). Please try reducing your tab/window width to a narrow width and report here what happens. If you continue to have further problems, I will need full details such as screen size in pixels, and all your preference settings including what skin you are using and whether you have adverts and Orbitz switched on or off... -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 04:09, 14 March 2013 (EDT) [ edit ] Emergency phone numbers I have made a start on adding the unified emergency phone number to the quickbar of about a dozen English speaking countries that have a unified common number but there are still a couple of hundred to go... -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 04:59, 12 March 2013 (EDT) For those who are interested in helping, this is an example of the type of edit that needs to be made (obviously the actual number or numbers will change between countries! -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 17:49, 22 March 2013 (EDT) [ edit ] Linking to Encyclopaedia Britannica articles Because we want to develop our own travel related content here (and also because travellers may be reading a printed version or off-line), we do not link to secondary sources here on the web\'s most read travel guide. However, we are not (and will never be) an encyclopaedia. We have a different aim and focus and a different tone . Our ability to use primary sources is one of the great strengths of our travel guide - nothing in Wikipedia is going to beat our ability to utilise the insights of people who have visited a destination recently - the conundrum comes in distinguishing which anecdotes we can rely on from those that are self-serving or mendacious and unfair . I think we should consider giving our readers free access to any of Britannica\'s 120,000 articles directly from this web site with special types of in-line links. IBadmins : You might want to ask your IT department to engineer special types of visually distinctive links brief instructions here , or we can just slightly change our policies so that when our readers click through the special type of in-line link to Britannica from our articles, he or she will be able to view the complete article\xe2\x80\x94even those that normally require a subscription to read\xe2\x80\x94as a free sample. For example, to link to the Britannica Online article on Horatio Nelson, Viscount Nelson from our own Nelson (New Zealand) article, the Britannica article URL is http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/408359/Horatio-Nelson-Viscount-Nelson Our HTML code then might look something like <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href=" http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/408359/Horatio-Nelson-Viscount-Nelson ">Viscount Horatio Nelson<img src=" http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/71/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica.svg " border="0" width="14" hspace="3" vspace="2" /></a> and display a little like: Viscount Horatio Nelson (I\'ve prepared a normal xl here without the logo in a version of our Nelson (New Zealand) article). Note: This code will link users to the article on the publicly accessible Britannica site britannica.com . Readers that they recognize as members of a college or library that subscribes to Britannica will have the same experience as a paid subscriber to the public site with full access to the entire site in an advertising-free environment. Readers that are not members of a subscribing institution will still be able to access the full article, however additional content may be restricted and users may be served advertising. Please note that, for readers that do not have access via a subscription, that the link will be to the full Britannica article only when the page holding the link is hosted on a Web Server. When you test this page on your local machine, it will still lead to the truncated version of the article. This is not an error, and when the same page is put on a Web Server it will still work as intended. -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 17:10, 16 March 2013 (EDT) [ edit ] Renovating our Listing format One of the great things about this travel guide is how easy we have made it for casual editors to both wt:add a listing and then update it as information like opening hours or prices change. However, currently businesses have a perverse double incentive not to use these great XML style listings, since that way they get to retain an obviously Clickable blue name and arrow symbol 3 Example St, \xe2\x98\x8e +65 1234 5678 and avoid that (baffling) Non-clickable black name in bold without arrow symbol , 3 Example St , \xe2\x98\x8e +65 1234 5678 , [1] . But with footnote style, meaninglessly incrementing number doohickey right at the end \xc2\xa0 edit . Please could the IT department make it a top priority to change this style so that the name="?" tag field becomes BLUE anchor text with the clickable arrow symbol directly after it in an identical way to the non-XML style listings? Please also remind them to implement HTML code similar to <a target="_blank" href="http://example-motel.com">Example Motel</a> in both styles so as to make the hyperlink open in a new window/tab so that a return to our great travel site is as easy and fast as just closing the spawned window or tab. At the same time, they could activate the geographical co-ordinate information. -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 02:00, 17 March 2013 (EDT) [ edit ] Joke article for 2013 Hello! April Fool\'s 2013 is coming up! Let\'s choose this year\'s joke article . Any suggestions?:) You can leave your comment here IBAlex 20:03, 14 March 2013 (EDT) [ edit ] Bot? Is User:Tyen a bot\xc2\xa0? He/she/it never replies and seems to be able ( Special:Contributions/Tyen ) to make 12 boilerplate welcoming edits to 12 separate user pages inside 60 seconds! Don\'t we have a policy that bots should be named and "owned" by a human being? Why can\'t I find any mention of this (eg: at Wikitravel:Bots )\xc2\xa0? -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 19:29, 18 March 2013 (EDT) These are two genuine questions that I would really like simple answers for; presumably Yes and/or No. It would also be nice to receive responses to the earlier issues. -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 14:51, 21 March 2013 (EDT) User:Tyen is not a bot. Cheers! IBAlex 15:10, 21 March 2013 (EDT) [ edit ] Blocked I appear to have been accidentally blocked and can only edit by logging out. Can anyone help? I have edits I need to make to my user page. User:LtPowers Also, my user page is protected, so I can\'t edit it. It still states that I\'m an administrator. LtPowers 15:26, 22 March 2013 (EDT) I\'m sorry to hear about these difficulties. I can\'t think of a better place to publicly leave a message like this. However, you might try leaving a message on their user talk pages to either User:IBobi or User:IBAlex or both; I know they are both active IBadmins here, just in case it\'s slipped their attention. Have you notified your resignation at Wikitravel:Administrator nominations \xc2\xa0? (Later) Good news! I see that your are no longer listed as an administrator here: http://wikitravel.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Special:ListUsers&group=sysop and User:IBobi seems to have already made the necessary adjustment to your user page . Is your complaint that you can not edit your User talk page? I assume that you are able to edit in other namespaces (since you seem to able to edit in the "Wikitravel" and main article namespaces)? -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 16:38, 22 March 2013 (EDT) Ugh, I forgot what it was I wanted to change! No, actually, I wanted to remove the Docent information on my user page, but with it protected I cannot. I did not resign my adminship, it was removed. Contrary to policy, I believe, but I never did get an answer on that one. LtPowers 16:53, 22 March 2013 (EDT) Mmmm, looking briefly at some edit histories, I have a strong suspicion that this is something you will need to take up directly with User:IBobi who was the original blocking/protecting IBadmin. For what it\'s worth, I do agree that it is not appropriate for you to be listed as a Docent when you are unwilling to undertake that job. Looking on the bright side, I see from your User talk page that you have not been troubled with too many requests that you have needed to decline recently. Since it seems the original problem is now obsolete (and the continuing problem with not being able to edit your own User page is probably better resolved directly with User:IBobi ) would you have any objection to my now archiving this topic as having been dealt with? -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 17:09, 22 March 2013 (EDT) Great news! User:IBAlex is on the job and has now edited your user page appropriately . -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 17:12, 22 March 2013 (EDT) [ edit ] Wikitravel upgrade - read-only mode for a few days beginning Monday, 25 March 2013 Hello all, We\'re excited to announce that Wikitravel will be upgrading its software next week. In order to migrate Wikitravel\'s extraordinary database of travel information, we\'ll be putting the site into read-only mode starting Monday 3/25/2013 and running for about three days. No edits will be possible at this time. When we come back, we\'ll be better than ever. Please let us know if there are any questions or concerns, -- IBobi 17:36, 22 March 2013 (EDT) Fantastic news! Will you be able to attend to some of the topics that need an answer further up this Pub page, or will they have to wait a while longer, please? -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 17:41, 22 March 2013 (EDT) Hi, I would like to know which local time you based on. Monday 3/25/2013 of UTC? Or EST or PST? Also, I want to know the approximate starting time. Since I want to notice ja: wikitravelers the correct information as well as possible, your corporation is very much appreciated.-- Shoestring 21:47, 22 March 2013 (EDT) An excellent point, Shoestring ! Perhaps the upgrade would be a suitable time to change the signature timestamps from the historical and East Coast of the US-centric EDT and EST over to UTC so that they match those in the edit summaries , histories, and everywhere else? After all most of the world is probably a bit confused by the East Coast\'s Summer times, and UTC (or "Zulu" time) is what the US military and scientific community use. (Please note that I have manually edited my timestamp to this message so that it is UTC (known by many Americans as Greenwich Mean Time or GMT) -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 02:25, 23 March 2013 (UTC) Dear Wikitravelers! The upgrade is planned to start Monday morning PST. Thank you for your cooperation!

S'Wikitravel:Ways to help Wikitravel - Wikitravel Help Wikitravel grow by contributing to an article! Learn how . Wikitravel:Ways to help Wikitravel From Wikitravel Jump to: navigation , search There are as many ways to help Wikitravel as there are Wikitravellers . This article is for those who like the idea of Wikitravel, but are having a hard time getting started with contributing. Update the article for the town/region you live in. Navigate to the article for your home town, either by going through the directory on the Main Page or using the search functionality. Take a good look to see that it\'s correct, if the article is there. Make sure that major attractions are listed. Would you recommend a restaurant or a pub that is currently missing? See if you can fill in any details (hours, prices, phone numbers) for any of the entries there. If there\'s not an article on your home town, start one ! Please, repeat this exercise for your home state or province, region, country, or whatever. Find articles to help with. There are many ways to do this. Special:Newpages gives you all the pages that have been created recently. Check that new pages are suitable for articles . Special:Recentchanges gives you the pages that have been edited recently. Watch recent changes for vandalism and inappropriate editing. Orphaned pages gives you articles that do not have links pointing to them. Unless you do something about them, they are most likely to be forgotten about, because contributors will ordinarily never come across them or improve them. Dead-end pages are those which do not link to any other. Sometimes this is okay, but often this indicates that the page has been created by a new user who is not yet familiar with inserting wikilinks. Special:Randompage , as the name suggests, will throw up a random page. Usually, you can find something to improve in any page. Proofread . This is one of the easiest ways to get started with helping with Wikitravel. While you\'re reading an article, watch for spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, or other writing gaffes. If you see one, edit the page and correct it. Wikitravel is now that much better -- thanks to you! Reformat articles . Wikitravel has a manual of style for giving a consistent look-and-feel to our content and making it easier for travellers to find and use information. Just as with proofreading, you can do a lot of good just by reformatting or restructuring articles to match the Manual. Articles that need reformatting are typically stub articles , which usually lack standard headings and outlines. See also any articles in Category:Articles needing attention . The dead end pages , which list articles without any links on them, are also worth a look, as are the various Wikitravel:Syntax checks . Organize the Geographical hierarchy . Work to help organise regions and to make make it easier to navigate the site. Rate articles . Wikitravel has a system to indicate the maturity status of articles. This helps keep track of what stage an article is in and how many articles are at what level of maturity. Expand listings. It can help a lot to take short restaurant listings , attraction listings , or other listings and fill them out. Contributors will often leave out crucial information about an attraction, such as its address, phone number, hours, or price. Often, this information can be found on the World Wide Web. Check for articles for places you\'ve visited. As with your home town, find articles for places you\'ve visited. Check them for accuracy, add information, or start them new. Don\'t limit yourself to things you already know. You don\'t have to have firsthand knowledge of a destination or topic to contribute to the article! Find articles that need work and do some research -- on Wikipedia , on the Web, or with other reference media -- to get started on working on that article. Make outlines. Don\'t be daunted by the task of writing all of the article about Russia -- just get it started with an outline . People are much more likely to change or add to articles than to start them from scratch. We have a bunch of handy templates for destination guides, which you can use. If you only know a teensy bit about a subject, go ahead and add it in. We currently have a huge backlog of stub articles that shouldn\'t really be there. It is easy to create an outline for most articles and move them to the next level. You can help there. Respond to requests. Sometimes people put up requests in the Wikitravel:Help wanted area for articles, images, or work to be done on articles. Keep an eye on these pages: Requests for images . Watch for wanted articles. The Special:Wantedpages feature of our software lets you see which articles have been linked to but not yet written. These are excellent places to get started -- you\'re filling in what is an obvious need for the travel guide. Follow red links. While you\'re reading articles, if you see a link for an article that\'s Not There Yet, follow the link and add in some information. We\'re nowhere near close to covering all the info we need to have -- when you start a new page , we\'re that much closer. Take Wikitravel with you. Before you go on a trip, try to find articles in Wikitravel about the destinations you\'re visiting. Print them out -- or download them to your PDA, or whatever -- and take them with you on your trip. Keep notes on what\'s right, what\'s wrong, and what\'s missing. If the destination you\'re going to isn\'t in Wikitravel yet, take notes for a new article to start when you get back. Join an Expedition . There are several tasks for making a real travel guide that require special skills and talents. We\'ve created special subprojects called Expeditions to organize the efforts of people who have these talents. Do you know a foreign (non-English) language? Help out with the Phrasebook Expedition . Can you draw? Try your hand at the Mapmaking Expedition . Promote Wikitravel. The more people who read and contribute to Wikitravel, the better it becomes, and the closer we get to our goal of making a free, complete, up-to-date and reliable world-wide travel guide. There are a number of ways to promote Wikitravel ; check to see if you can do one or more of them. Help new contributors. New users contributing to Wikitravel can have a lot of questions and problems. Your experience with Wikitravel can make their learning curve a lot easier. Watch for questions in the travellers\' pub or on talk pages and respond helpfully. If you see the same question over and over, add it to the FAQ . You can even add to the Help index for more complicated questions or issues. If there are help topics already in place that people seem not to see or understand, maybe you can help get that information out by reorganizing the help area. Cheerlead. Nothing makes people feel better than knowing their work is appreciated. When you see a good piece of writing, or a great picture, or whatever, let the Wikitraveller who made it know that you liked it. Just a bit of encouragement on the article\'s talk page , or on the user\'s user talk page , can make a world of difference. Shape the community. Our project is still young, and much of the way we\'ve decided to work together is still untested. If you have ideas for how to work together better, please suggest them as new policies and guidelines . It doesn\'t matter how long you\'ve been a Wikitraveller: you just might have an idea that will make things work smoother. At worst, you\'ll make explicit some policy that\'s currently implicit; that\'s a good thing. If there are policies already in place that people aren\'t following, maybe you can help get that information out by reorganizing the policies area. Welcome new users. When new users come onto Wikitravel, it\'s nice to leave them a brief welcome message pointing them to important parts of the site. We normally wait until folks have created a user account and possibly set up their own user page . Welcome messages let new contributors know that they\'re part of a community, and also make sure they have pointers to important tools for contributing. Clean up the travellers\' pub. The travellers\' pub , as the default place to put discussions about Wikitravel, tends to get a little crowded at times. For this reason people take turns moving discussions out of the pub and into the archives or to more specific talk pages. It only takes a few minutes, it helps make discussions more clear, and it\'s easy to do. Make or edit policy and style guidelines. The policies and manual of style define how we work together to make a great travel guide. If you\'re working on Wikitravel and think there\'s ways we can make a better guide, or we can work together better to achieve our goals , by all means start a new policy or guideline page! We try to make decisions by consensus , so there\'s no guarantee that your idea will be accepted, but it definitely won\'t be if you don\'t suggest it in the first place! Work on MediaWiki . The software we use for Wikitravel is called MediaWiki . If you know the PHP programming language, contributing to MediaWiki really helps Wikitravel. Fixing bugs or adding features makes it easier for other Wikitravellers to add great content.

S'Wikitravel:Welcome, newcomers - Wikitravel Help Wikitravel grow by contributing to an article! Learn how . Wikitravel:Welcome, newcomers From Wikitravel Jump to: navigation , search Contents Finding travel information Share your knowledge More information See also Welcome to Wikitravel ! We, the Wikitravellers who\'ve made it, hope that you enjoy what you see and that you join us in making a free , up-to-date, complete and reliable world-wide travel guide. [ edit ] Finding travel information Travel guides on Wikitravel are mostly arranged geographically. You generally won\'t find articles on attractions, hotels and restaurants, but you hopefully will find all that information and more in our destination guide articles for countries, cities, and towns. You can try searching for the destination you are interested in. You may be taken immediately to a guide for that destination, or if there isn\'t a guide on that destination, you will see a list of articles that mention it. You can also try searching for the name of a attraction you are looking for, and the search will return a list of relevant articles. Alternatively, you can browse through our geographical hierarchy. You can start at the continents and regions listed on our Main Page , and work your way down through the region, city and district links to the area you are interested in. After you have found the guide for the area you are interested in, there may still be more information waiting for you to read. We don\'t cover information on how to get into a country in every destination guide. You won\'t find visa information for Australia in the Sydney article. So, if you are coming from further afield, you may want to refer to the breadcrumb links at the top of the page, and read the country or region guide, to make sure you have the full picture. We don\'t list general travel information in every guide. We have helpful articles on things like money , visas , how to stay safe and how to deal with language barriers in our list of travel topics . Remember that Wikitravel is an open guide that anyone can edit. Often that means you can get up to the minute information and inside information on attractions and the latest buzz, but sometimes it means that some information can be unverified and unreliable. As with any other guide, you should double check and confirm any information that is critical to the success of your travels. If you have particular travel questions that aren\'t covered in a guide, you can ask a docent . A docent is a volunteer guide, and if there is one for your area there will be a link in the sidebar on the left containing their contact information. For general questions, post a message in our Travellers\' pub . You\'re free to use the articles in Wikitravel in almost any way, thanks to our copyleft license. [ edit ] Share your knowledge This is a reader-created Web site; all the information you see in Wikitravel was contributed by Internet users just like you. We\'re trying to create, illustrate, and edit a travel guide for the entire world , and we need your help . It\'s a humongous job. As they say, though, "Many hands make light work;" anything you can do to contribute is appreciated. You don\'t have to be an "expert" in travel; you just have to be interested enough to get started. You\'re always welcome to plunge forward and make changes to any page on the site (including this one). Just click the Edit this page link, and you\'ll get a Web form that lets you change the contents of the page. Hit Save page , and your version is what\'s shown on the site. (If you\'re nervous, feel free to practice on the graffiti wall ). If you find yourself getting more involved, you may want to read our tips for new contributors . Our list of goals and non-goals give a good idea of what we\'re trying to do with Wikitravel. If you\'ve got some specific info you want to share, we have some guidelines on where you can stick it (pun intended). You can also read our manual of style for more clues as to how to edit and layout guides, but don\'t worry too much about that stuff if you don\'t want. Don\'t forget to describe yourself on your user page to help other contributors to communicate with you (and even to ask for your help sometimes). There are other ways to help Wikitravel , too. We have a lot of stuff that needs to be done. And if you have special skills or interests, consider joining a related Expedition . [ edit ] More information We have quite a bit of help documentation to make reading and editing Wikitravel as easy as we can. If you have any questions about Wikitravel, please read our FAQ first to see if it\'s already answered. If not, feel free to ask your question in the travellers\' pub , where friendly Wikitravellers will help guide your way. We can\'t say how important it is to us that you are reading and contributing on Wikitravel. If you need anything , just ask us (however you can). We want you to enjoy Wikitravel, to find the info you need, and (we hope) to be inspired to share your knowledge with others.

S'Wikitravel:What is a docent? - Wikitravel Help Wikitravel grow by contributing to an article! Learn how . Wikitravel:What is a docent? From Wikitravel Jump to: navigation , search Contents What is a docent? How can I contact a docent? What can a docent do for me? Which locations have docents? What can I do if my destination has no docent? See also Greetings, traveller! If you\'re reading this, you\'ve probably clicked on a link on one of our travel guides, wondering "What is a docent?", "How can I contact a docent?", or "What can a docent do for me?" Here are your answers. [ edit ] What is a docent? The dictionary says a docent (say DOUGH-sent) is "a trained volunteer museum guide. A docent is at once a volunteer, a teacher, and a guide." Well we\'re not a museum, but that\'s still a pretty good description of what docents do here on Wikitravel. Docents are volunteers\xe2\x80\x94fellow users of this site\xe2\x80\x94who know a lot about a particular destination. They\'ve volunteered their time and knowledge to help travellers like you who have questions. [ edit ] How can I contact a docent? If a destination has a docent who has volunteered to help, you will see his or her username on the left side of your screen, underneath the search box. If you don\'t see the "Destination Docents" box, then that destination has no docent. If you do see a docent listed, you can click on his or her username and you\'ll be taken to the docent\'s User Page. There, the docent should have a clearly-labeled section that lists the destinations he or she is familiar with and explains his or her preferred contact method. Usually, you can contact a docent by leaving a message on his or her User Talk Page, but some docents may prefer e-mail, or another contact method. You should also be aware that some docents have become inactive and don\'t check their talk pages as often, or at all. If you don\'t get a response, don\'t take it personally; sometimes people move on to other things. However you contact your docent, remember to always be courteous and patient. Docents are volunteers and can be very busy in what we call "real life"\xe2\x80\x94working, taking care of children, etc. Plan ahead so that the docent has plenty of time to get back to you before your trip. [ edit ] What can a docent do for me? We\'re trying to write travel guides that cover just about any question you might have, but it\'s a long, slow process. If you have a question\xe2\x80\x94any question at all\xe2\x80\x94about a destination, you can ask a docent. They can tell you the best way to get to an attraction, the best place to get local cuisine, or which areas of a city you should avoid. Docents are not for hire. They may not even live anywhere near your destination. They won\'t meet you in person and take you on tours. They\'re only here to provide you with information and guidance. Keep your expectations in line. [ edit ] Which locations have docents? We have an alphabetical list of destinations with docents, though there\'s no guarantee that a particular docent is still active. [ edit ] What can I do if my destination has no docent? You can try asking a question on the article\'s Talk Page (click on the "discussion" tab at the top of the page); people who have edited the article might see your question and be able to answer it, or tell you where to find an answer. If you can\'t get your question answered, take heart. Go ahead and plunge forward and travel to your destination. Find out the answer to your question there. When your trip is over, you can bring that answer back and write it into the destination\'s article . It\'s as easy as clicking the "edit" button at the top of the page, and then you\'ll be a Wikitraveller too!

S'Copyleft - Wikitravel Shared "Wikitravel has a speed and convenience the books\' publishers can only envy." \xe2\x80\x94 Time Europe Copyleft From Wikitravel Shared Jump to: navigation , search Contents Licensing Things for users to know Things for contributors to know [+] Frequently asked questions What do I need to do to get writing? What do I need to do to get uploading images? How will I be attributed? Can GFDL content be used on Wikitravel? Can I copy text and other content to Wikitravel from other sites? If content is available free-of-charge, can it be used here? How should I ask for permission to use a forum reply on Wikitravel? See also The Universal License of Our Wiki Wikitravel uses a copyleft license for all text, images, and other content on the Web site. Anyone can use Wikitravel content according to the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license. And anyone can contribute their own or other people\'s text and images, as long as the work is their own or available under a compatible license. It is very important that you understand how copyleft works before you contribute to Wikitravel . If you find your work reused by someone else in a manner that you didn\'t consider, or if you stop using Wikitravel for any reason, it is not possible to change the license for the text and photographs you have already submitted. Although you always own the copyright in your work, that does not give you the right to change how it can be used retrospectively. [ edit ] Licensing If this seems confusing, skip down to the FAQ . All written contributions to Wikitravel are and must be licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 ( CC-by-SA 3.0 ) or a compatible license (e.g., Public Domain, CC-by-SA any, dual CC-by-SA/GDFL any, etc.). Consequently, all redistributed and derivative works of Wikitravel text must also be licensed as CC-by-SA 3.0. Files uploaded to Wikitravel are and must be licensed under any of the available options in the pulldown menu on the upload form . Consequently, all redistributed and derivative works including Wikitravel images and other files must provide file-specific attribution and licensing information, available on the individual file page. Two small subsets of images on Wikitravel may be copyrighted, and not available for redistribution or derivative works, although these copyrighted images will never appear in a Wikitravel article. For more information on these narrow categories of copyrighted images, see Template:Copyrighted . [ edit ] Things for users to know Copyleft means that every single author, editor, illustrator, mapmaker, factchecker and photographer who puts their work into Wikitravel gives you the right to read, copy, print, save, download, read aloud, project, modify, email, distribute, sell, photocopy and correct their work however you want to. The only restrictions are that: if you distribute it, or derive new work from it you must give attribution to the creators you must retain the work and any derivative works under the same licensing . Attribution In other words, we give you practically every freedom within the boundaries of the law to use the information in Wikitravel, except the freedom to take that freedom away from others. The license we use is the Attribution-ShareAlike license. It\'s a piece of legal documentation created by the great people at Creative Commons that basically says the same thing as above: give Wikitravellers credit for their work, and share with other people. If you want you can read the full text of the Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license . For the purposes of the License, a Work is the formatted text that makes up a single Wikitravel Shared article. Each file individually is also a Work for the purposes of the License. In addition, there may be other restrictions on use or distribution based on law in your country or state; in particular, consider privacy rights for photographs of people and derivative works for photographs of buildings and artworks. Lastly, to the extent possible there is no warranty on any of the articles or images in Wikitravel. Hotels close; bars raise prices; train schedules change; earthquakes, mudslides, wars and lightning strikes destroy sights, statues and cities. People make mistakes. Wikitravellers try their best, but none of the creators of these pages are responsible to you in any way for any injury or discomfort you endure before, after, or during your travels. See the License above for details. If you\'re setting up a mirror web site, you might want to check out How to re-use Wikitravel guides . [ edit ] Things for contributors to know Share-Alike Copyleft means that every single yahoo, nutcase, screwjob, charlatan, shyster, weirdo, freakazoid, mouthbreather, goofball, lamer, cheater and jerk will have the right to read, copy, print, save, download, read aloud, project, modify, email, distribute, sell, photocopy and correct your work however they want to. In particular , your work can be ruthlessly modified, edited, or cut from Wikitravel altogether by other Wikitravellers . It can be photocopied thousands of times and passed around as flyers by itinerant backpackers. It can be put in Hollywood movies, and it can be projected onto a screen at an outdoor rave. It can be used for commercial ventures, advertisements, or other purposes (with some restrictions - see privacy rights ) without your direct control. In return for your incredible generosity , you will have the knowledge that you are helping travellers all over the world, and that all copies made of your work will be attributed to you, and that everyone who derives new works from yours will have to be just as generous as you are. And, of course, you get to use all the other work in Wikitravel Shared the same way; but you don\'t need to contribute to do that. You\'ll also get the pleasure of collaborating with hundreds of other Wikitravellers just like yourself. You\'ll get free spellcheck service from nit-picky folks you\'ve never met. You\'ll work together with people you don\'t know to make better pictures, text, and maps than you\'ve ever dreamed of. You still retain the copyright over your own work, and you can use it any other way you want (even if it\'s not compatible with our license!). By writing on Wikitravel, or uploading photos, you\'re using a license under which all our work is available - making it simpler for everyone. Now, the hard part: because of the Attribution-ShareAlike license, you are legally responsible not to put other people\'s copyrighted work into Wikitravel without permission. You are responsible for getting model releases from people you take pictures of, and you are responsible for any libel you include in your articles. Before editing Wikitravel articles or uploading pictures, you should read very carefully the full text of the Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license , and make sure that you agree to it. For images, it\'s important to mark the image as either your own work, or give information on who made the picture and why you think it\'s acceptable under the broad terms of Attribution-Sharealike that govern Wikitravel\'s licensing. See Wikitravel Shared:Image policy for more information. We want to make the best possible travel guide, with the most brilliant writing, the most up-to-date info, the most awe-inspiring photos, the most detailed and readable maps. But no one item is worth putting yourself and this project in legal jeopardy. If you have any questions about the source of something you want to put in Wikitravel, ask about it first . When in doubt, leave it out. [ edit ] Frequently asked questions By = Attribution [ edit ] What do I need to do to get writing? Nothing , just plunge forward! Whenever you save something you write, you automatically license it for use under CC-by-SA 3.0. So all you need to do is get started writing\xe2\x80\x94if the text is your own original writing, don\'t worry about licenses. [ edit ] What do I need to do to get uploading images? First, be sure that the image is either one created by you or one that is freely licensed (see "Can I copy text and other content to Wikitravel from other sites?" below). Second, you should register an account on Wikitravel Shared, the central repository for Wikitravel files. Then, go to the upload screen , where you select the file to upload and enter an upload summary. The summary must include a choice of license from the pulldown menu, as well as attribution information indicating how you wish to be credited. If the image is not your own, be sure to provide accurate licensing and attribution information, as well as a link to the source from which you got the image. The simplest way to make sure everything is correctly documented is to use the image credit template (see How to upload files for detailed instructions). If the template seems too intimidating, an acceptable comment might be: Image copyright 2006 by [[User:YourNameHere]], dual-licensed under the CC-SA 1.0 (or later) and the GFDL. Taken by [[User:YourNameHere]]. There are some additional restrictions in specific cases (such as when photographing people) so please also read our Image policy . [ edit ] How will I be attributed? You will only be attributed for text contributions if you register a user account. Whatever you enter as your "real name" will appear in the revision history of any pages you modify, serving as attribution. If you register, but decline to enter a "real name," you will be attributed by your user name. For files you upload, you must provide the attribution information yourself in the upload summary. So, just indicate however you want to be attributed as you upload the file! [ edit ] Can GFDL content be used on Wikitravel? See also: Why Wikitravel isn\'t GFDL This is complicated. In a nutshell: Text licensed under any version of the GFDL is not compatible with Wikitravel. Images that are licensed under GFDL 1.3 or later , including eg. "GFDL 1.1 or later", are compatible with Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 and can be uploaded to Wikitravel Shared. Images licensed (only) under GFDL 1.2 or earlier are not compatible with Wikitravel and cannot be used. [ edit ] Can I copy text and other content to Wikitravel from other sites? Usually No . That is, unless you are the original author of the text, or the other website has been explicitly licensed as compatible with Creative Commons Attribution/Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0, or it is in the public domain. If you are the original author of the text, note that on the article talk page, or else someone will likely remove it as a copyright violation. Wikimedia projects like Wikipedia have a compatible license, so we can copy relevant text (although copying significant amount of text is discouraged). When copying content from another site with a compatible license be sure to provide proper attribution, as required by the CC-by-SA license. This means citing the license, author and source of images on any image page, and noting the license, author and source of text content on the article talk page . For the content to be public domain, it needs to be created by the US Federal Government, the city government of Washington, D.C., or have a statement on the website saying it is released into the public domain. Lack of a copyright notice does not mean the content is free to re-use\xe2\x80\x94all online content is automatically copyrighted unless the author explicitly states otherwise. [ edit ] If content is available free-of-charge, can it be used here? Probably not. Just because a map, brochure, or other item is given away for free does not mean that it has been freely licensed . For content to be usable on Wikitravel the content copyright owner must agree to license it under the CC-SA 3.0 or a compatible license. [ edit ] How should I ask for permission to use a forum reply on Wikitravel? The following template can help. Please quote your original message and reply to it at the respective article\'s Talk page. You may provide attribution to the original author(s) listing them by a template like en:Template:Attribution . Hi (person name). Do you mind if I use some pieces of your post (<forum post URL>) to contribute to an article on <destination> at Wikitravel, a free online travel guide written and edited entirely by travelers from around the globe? The current edition of the article I am going to update is here: <article URL>. Wikitravel requires that all the content is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license. Basically this means that your content: - can be distributed by others, as long as you are credited as the author - may be further edited by other contributors So do you mind if I use your text at Wikitravel? <your signature> You may also use the following text, which you need the copyright holder to clearly acknowledge: I hereby assert that I am the creator and/or sole owner of the exclusive copyright of WORK [the filename]. The text of this web page is available for modification and reuse under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribute Share-Alike, version 3,0 and earlier. I acknowledge that I grant anyone the right to use the work in a commercial product, and to modify it according to their needs, as long as they abide by the terms of the license and any other applicable laws. I am aware that I always retain copyright of my work, and retain the right to be attributed in accordance with the license chosen. Modifications others make to the work will not be attributed to me. I am aware that the free license only concerns copyright, and I reserve the option to take action against anyone who uses this work in a libelous way, or in violation of personality rights, trademark restrictions, etc. I acknowledge that I cannot withdraw this agreement, and that the work may or may not be kept permanently on a Wikitravel project.

S'How to re-use Wikitravel guides - Wikitravel Shared "Wikitravel has a speed and convenience the books\' publishers can only envy." \xe2\x80\x94 Time Europe How to re-use Wikitravel guides From Wikitravel Shared Jump to: navigation , search Wikitravel articles and images are available under a copyleft license. This means you can redistribute and modify them in any medium, as long as you follow a few simple rules. [ edit ] The short answer To redistribute Wikitravel content, you must: Attribute the authors of the content (Not just Wikitravel). Clearly note that the Wikitravel text content as being available under the CC-by-SA 3.0 license, and note the specific copyright for each image. There are no other requirements. [ edit ] About our license Our license, the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 , requires three main things from people redistributing an article: You give attribution to the authors of the article. You make any derivative works available under the same license. You notify readers and other users of the license. The following is our interpretation of the license requirements. It is not legal advice . [ edit ] Attribution You can give attribution to the authors according to their real names (preferred) or Wikitravel user names. For users identified with an IP address instead of a user name, you can use "Anonymous" or "Anonymous user of Wikitravel". You don\'t have to list any name more than once. [ edit ] Text Every page on Wikitravel has a credits block at the end of the page; for pages where all the authors names will fit in it, this should be sufficient for attribution. However, when there are too many authors names to fit in that block, you must follow the others link at the end of the block to get the complete set of credits for attribution. Each Wikitravel article also has an HTML link element of type meta that points to an RDF file with the author names. This may be easier to parse automatically. Sample wording : This page is based on work by John Smith, Jane Jones and other users . Alternatively, you may choose to simply point back to the credits of the original Wikitravel article: Sample wording : A list of contributors is available at the original article on Wikitravel. [ edit ] Images For images, the author history can (only) be found on the corresponding Image: page. Images often have image specific licensing and attribution which differs from the article itself, so you should double check the image file page before redistributing or creating derivative works, to make certain you provide accurate licensing & attribution information. [ edit ] ShareAlike Any redistributed Wikitravel articles or derivative works based on Wikitravel articles must also be licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0. Redistributed images or derivative works based on Wikitravel images must remain under the same license as appears on the individual image page (it is necessary to "click through" the thumbnail to get to individual image pages). [ edit ] Notice You must provide a link to the Attribution-ShareAlike license to notify readers and users of their rights to the article text or image. The URL of the license should be sufficient. Sample wording : Content on this page is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license . [ edit ] Practice These are some practical notes for re-using Wikitravel guides. wikitravel.org is a service for creating and editing these free guides. We can\'t support the bandwidth and processing requirements of uses not tuned to this purpose. We prefer not to serve files or articles if they\'re framed or embedded into other pages. If you create a Web mirror, it can help if you put a link on en:Wikitravel:Mirrors . [ edit ] Link back Wikitravel articles are written, edited, and illustrated by readers. Our quality improves when readers can fix factual errors, misspellings, or other make other improvements. For this reason, we ask that you also link back to the original Wikitravel article, allowing your readers to update it. This is just a request; it\'s not part of the license requirements. A link back is not a substitute for following the terms of the license. [ edit ] API A MediaWiki API for programmatic access to the site is available at http://wikitravel.org/wiki/ code /api.php, where code is one of the language versions of Wikitravel, eg. "en" for English. When using the API, please follow the terms of use and download no more than one article every 30 seconds, or you may be blocked without warning. [ edit ] XML data feeds Ideally, it would be possible to obtain XML data dumps of Wikitravel content, to facilitate the reuse of Wikitravel content, in line with the intent of the Attribution-ShareAlike license and the goals of this site. Internet Brands , the company that owns Wikitravel\'s servers, has expressed the wish to restrict access to XML data dumps and to consider requests for them on an individual basis. To date no one has actually obtained an XML data dump from Internet Brands. Please see en:Wikitravel:Database dump for more details.

Please click here to begin! Wikitravel Shared is the central coordination point and shared repository for images and other media for all language versions of Wikitravel , the free, complete, up-to-date and reliable world-wide travel guide. Wikitravel Shared currently contains 35,119 files uploaded by Wikitravellers. Wikitravel strives to be a leader in travel research with up-to-date and complete articles, and images can often convey more than a thousand words. Some articles may already have images, however, should you happen to have an image that captures the soul of the destination please replace the current image with your own. Additionally, some articles don\'t have any images at all and we welcome any contribution you can make. Please visit the list of the articles without an image at Requests for images . Images by geography Africa Asia Australasia & Oceania Europe Middle East North America Central America & Caribbean South America See also : Cuisine , Maps , Events and festivals , Other Tech requests Bug reports : file new bug \xe2\x80\xa2 top bugs \xe2\x80\xa2 open bugs \xe2\x80\xa2 fixed bugs Feature requests : file new feature request \xe2\x80\xa2 roadmap \xe2\x80\xa2 open features \xe2\x80\xa2 finished features Useful functions Image search Create an account (required for uploading) Upload an image List of new images How to use Shared images To use a Shared image on any Wikitravel language version, just use the normal syntax [[Image: filename.jpg ]] to include it. Either the English Image: or the local language ( Bild: , \xe7\x94\xbb\xe5\x83\x8f: , etc) can be used as the command. The Wikitravel software will automatically check both the Shared and the local image repositories for the image. Note that if the same filename exists on both the local site and the Shared site, the local image has precedence.

Small wages. Bitter cold. Long months of complete darkness. Constant danger. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in case of success." -- Apocryphal recruitment poster for 1914 Antarctic expedition of HMS Endurance Wikitravellers are members of a world-wide community of contributors to Wikitravel . Wikitravel hasn\'t been around long enough to get any distinct idea for what kind of people Wikitravellers are, but it\'s probably safe to say that people who are involved with Wikitravel care about travel in general, and about sharing knowledge with others in particular. Wikitravellers are not a special secret organization or a limited group. We\'re people just like you, interested in travel, and willing to share what we know. You can become a Wikitraveller right now ! We need your help to make this project a success. We have a long way to go -- and anything you can do to contribute gets us that much closer.

FEES AND PAYMENTS. If you are purchasing a Copysentry subscription, it will renew and continue automatically, unless terminated by Indigo Stream or until you notify Indigo Stream of your decision to terminate your subscription by canceling your service on-line at http://www.copyscape.com/cancel.php. If there are any annual, monthly, or other periodic fees for your subscription, you authorize Indigo Stream to automatically bill these fees to the credit card, depending on the type of charge card you designate during the registration process for the Services or subsequently designate at the start of the annual, monthly or similar period, and at the start of each renewal period, unless you terminate your subscription before the relevant period begins. Indigo Stream outsources all online payment processing to RBS WorldPay or PayPal. Indigo Stream does not have access to credit card numbers and certain other payment information submitted to RBS WorldPay or PayPal as a result of the online payment process. You agree to provide RBS WorldPay or PayPal with a valid credit card and accurate, complete and updated information required by the subscription registration form. Failure to comply may result in the immediate termination of Services. If you want to designate a different credit card or there is a change in credit card validity or expiration date, you must modify your credit card details at the WorldPay Shopper Management System, at http://www.rbsworldpay.com/shopper/, or through the PayPal site. If you believe someone has accessed the Services using your username and password without your authorization, you must inform Indigo Stream via the technical support page at http://www.copyscape.com/support.php. You must contact Indigo Stream via the technical support page at http://www.copyscape.com/support.php about any billing problems or discrepancies within 60 days after they first appear on your account statement. If you do not bring them to Indigo Stream\'s attention within 60 days, you agree that you waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies. You also are responsible for any fees or charges incurred to access the Services through an Internet access provider or other third party service. YOU, AND NOT INDIGO STREAM, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, WHICH WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU. YOUR RIGHT TO CANCEL RENEWAL OF SERVICES. You may cancel your renewal of the Services at any time at http://www.copyscape.com/cancel.php. When cancelling a renewal, you will still receive access to the Services for the period for which you have paid. YOUR RIGHT TO CANCEL SERVICES. If you wish to cancel a subscription period that you have already paid for, you must contact Indigo Stream on-line at http://www.copyscape.com/support.php. If you have purchased a subscription, and you cancel within seven days of purchase, you have the right to receive a full refund of your subscription fee, in accordance with EU E-commerce regulations. If you have purchased a subscription, and you cancel at any time after the seven day period, you will not receive a refund for the period in which you cancel, but you will not be billed for any renewal periods. In the event you cancel after the seven day period, and you are not eligible for a refund under the terms of this Agreement, you will still receive access to the Services for the balance of that period for which you have paid. Other than as explicitly set forth in this Agreement, all payments are non-refundable. All subscriptions start the day you order the Services (and such day is included in the calculation of the termination periods). All cancellation dates will be the date that your cancellation notice is received. You understand and agree that cancellation of your subscription is your sole right and remedy with respect to any dispute with Indigo Stream. This includes, but is not limited to, any dispute related to, or arising out of: (1) any term of this Agreement or the enforcement or application of this Agreement; (2) any policy or practice of Indigo Stream, including any Indigo Stream Privacy Policy, or Indigo Stream\'s enforcement or application of these policies; (3) the content available through the Services or the Internet or any change in content provided through the Service; (4) your ability to access and/or use the Services; (5) the amount or type of fees, applicable taxes, billing methods, or any change to the fees, applicable taxes, or billing methods.

By Dave Johnson Mar 21, 2013 Windows 8 isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t the only new thing from Redmond; there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a fresh version of Office as well. But this time around, there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a confusing array of versions (Office 2013, Office 365, and many more) and a pricing model that some find distressing. Which version of Office is right for you? Or is the right answer: \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93None of the above?\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd Once a month, eHow Tech editor Dave Johnson faces off against Rick Broida, who writes about technology for CNET, PC World, and Wired. Follow along as they tackle this question from opposing corners. Dave : Microsoft products tend to have a three-year gestation cycle, which means that we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve now got the newest version of Office, whether we need it or not. There was a time when I would automatically lap up the latest version of Office as if it were chocolate gravy, but this year, I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m not so sure. Now you have to choose between Office Professional 2013 (a $400 copy you buy outright) and Office 365 Home Premium (a $100 subscription you have to pay every year or the software just stops working). Microsoft seems to have gone out of its way to make upgrading to Office 2013 an unappealing and difficult decision. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m more than half inclined to recommend that people switch to LibreOffice , the free open source alternative. Rick : LibreOffice, OpenOffice , Kingsoft Office Free 2012 , Google Docs , or any of the other free alternatives. I, too, find it borderline insulting that Microsoft continues to charge such steep prices for Office, especially in the face of such competent competitors. That said, the $99-per-year option doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t seem quite so bad when you consider that it nets you the equivalent of five licenses. Everyone in your family can run Office on their laptop, desktop, tablet, or whatever. Amortized out that way, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s $20 per person per year \xe2\x80\x94 a little more palatable, no? Dave : Yes, if you happen to be the Von Trapp Family Singers. But how many ordinary folks need five different copies of Office? My family could use two copies. Three, max. Yet I have to pay for five. And that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s $100 per year, every year, literally for the rest of my life. At least if I bought a boxed copy, I could pay once and choose when \xe2\x80\x94 or if \xe2\x80\x94 I wanted to give more money to Microsoft for another upgrade. Office 365 is like a bully you have to keep paying so he doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t hit you. Worse, did you catch what happened with Office Pro? Microsoft originally changed their licensing for Office 2013 by saying you could only install it on a single PC, once, for the life of the software. If your laptop was hit the next day by a meteor or stolen by a flying squirrel, tough luck. You had to buy a new $300 copy. Only when the Internet revolted did they back off that policy. Rick : You\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re starting to make an awful lot of sense, which is scary. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll admit that as a self-proclaimed cheapskate, I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d never subscribe to Microsoft Office, even if I was sharing it among five people, for exactly the reason you describe: it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a life sentence. But there is one bright spot in Microsoft\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s otherwise flawed pricing plans: education. Students can get Office 365 University (plus an extra 20GB of SkyDrive storage) for four years for just $79.99. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s $20 per year! Makes me want to go back to school. Dave : Why are we even having this conversation? It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s insane to spend $400 for a software package in 2013. You can buy an entire computer for that! What\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s even new in Office 2013 to justify my money? Most people hardly use a fraction of the features in Office to begin with Take a survey of how most people use Excel, for example. In any given office, 8 out of 10 people use it like a giant table to organize information. They are only barely aware that the program does math any more sophisticated than addition and subtraction. These people \xe2\x80\x94 most people \xe2\x80\x94 should be using a free alternative. Rick : I agree 100 percent: Office has lots of features that few people use. On the other hand, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s Microsoft\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s bestselling product (other than Windows, of course), so obviously people like it and want it. And Office 2013/365 represents the best version yet because it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s cloud-savvy and has interface improvements that actually make sense. In Outlook, for example, there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a one-click option to view only your unread e-mail. And the controversial Ribbon is now optional; you can hide it if you prefer. Price notwithstanding, this is the single best office suite you can buy, period. In fact, take price out of the picture entirely and tell me you wouldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t choose Office 2013 over all competitors. Dave : Well of course I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d choose Office if it were free . I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d also live on a diet of cupcakes and pizza if they were nutritionally equivalent to broccoli. If I had to be honest to our readers, I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d say that only suckers (and businesses with deep pockets) spend money on a word processor and spreadsheet program anymore. After all, if a one-click \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93view unread mail\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd button is the best reason you can think of to spend $400 (or $100 a year for life), then innovation is truly dead. Can you give me even a single reason not to switch to LibreOffice this very afternoon? Rick : Sure: Outlook. There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s no other contact/calendar/mail manager around that even comes close. LibreOffice and its ilk don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t even have a mail client. The only viable open-source option is Thunderbird, but Mozilla has stopped developing it. What\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s more, you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re overlooking a very important consideration for consumers and business users alike: file compatibility. Few free/open-source Office alternatives are fully file-compatible with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Some can open those kinds of documents, but most can save only to older formats. Talk about a hassle! Dave : You make a fair point about Outlook. For some reason, software developers appear to have given up on creating full-featured mail clients about 20 years ago. I can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t even remember the last time I saw any mail program at all aside from Outlook. Weird, right? But no worries \xe2\x80\x94 just use Gmail instead. Or Outlook.com. Webmail supports POP and IMAP just fine. And as for file compatibility, I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll say that open source alternatives are compatible enough. They read and write Office file formats just fine 90% of the time. Sure, there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s an occasional glitch, but honestly, I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve even run into bizarre compatibility problems between different versions of Word. So, nothing\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s perfect. Good enough. Rick : Hey, pal, we didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t put a man on the moon with \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93good enough.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd If you want the best productivity suite money can buy, you need Microsoft Office. Much as I wish I could hand-pick my own suite (Word, Excel, OneNote, and Publisher, please) and buy it for, say, $50, sometimes you have to pony up. A milk crate is \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93good enough\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd to sit on, but when I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m parked in front of the TV, I want a comfy leather couch. And that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s what Office is: my comfy leather couch. You enjoy your crate, sir. Who won? We\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d love to hear from you.

Establishing routines is key to running a well-oiled household. But, how do you know when it\xe2\x80\x99s time to change things up, offer your children more freedom and step up the responsibilities of each family member? \xe2\x80\x9cAs children grow older, there are two possible pitfalls: letting them stay babies or trying to make them grow up too fast,\xe2\x80\x9d said Crystal Lutton, Arizona-based mom of five and author of \xe2\x80\x9cGrace-Based Living.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFinding that balance of respecting them where they are is such an important thing.\xe2\x80\x9d If your children seem bored or even resistant when it comes to chores, rules, allowances and even bedtimes, it may be time to re-evaluate the routine. Tuning In to Your Child A household will run much more smoothly if you\'re willing to re-evaluate what\'s working on a daily basis. Even though your child may excel at completing his chore chart each day, he may need to be challenged to take on more responsibility. Lutton recommends giving him opportunities to show you what he can do. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes, I will ask (children) to run and do something for me, and I see if they can,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they can\xe2\x80\x99t, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine. I just jump in to help, but I am often surprised.\xe2\x80\x9d As soon as children start showing initiative, Lutton says, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to move out of the way. \xe2\x80\x9cNo need to be offended by the \xe2\x80\x98me do it myself\xe2\x80\x99 stage," she said. "Let them." Reminders of the need for more responsibility will also prepare your children for additional duties. \xe2\x80\x9cI spend a lot of time telling my children, \xe2\x80\x98When you are able, you will use the potty, clean your room and put away groceries,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Lutton said. Behavior and age will also help you determine when to increase a child\'s household chores and responsibilities. Lutton said she did this when her kids hit 5, 8 and 11. \xe2\x80\x9cI can tell it\xe2\x80\x99s time to increase responsibilities when the child does what I term \xe2\x80\x98stealing freedom.\xe2\x80\x99 Often they begin to sneak around and do something unacceptable,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cAt that point, we sit down and I explain that any stolen privilege is one you are not ready for, but their behavior is showing me that they are ready for more freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d The child has to understand the only way to get the freedom she\'s ready for is to take on more responsibility, Lutton says. \xe2\x80\x9cResponsibility earns privileges," she said. "We talk about some chores they can begin to take on and we talk about something that I will give them as a privilege because of this new level of responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d Family Chores Developing a chore plan for the entire family could keep your household in shape and your children motivated. Jennifer Kogan, a family therapist in Washington, D.C., recommends a family meeting to determine responsibilities. \xe2\x80\x9cThis should be framed as a fun activity where parents can then outline for everyone that they want everyone to contribute something to help the house function,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cKids and parents can draw or write their ideas on paper and it can then be posted somewhere where people can see and refer to it.\xe2\x80\x9d The key element is to have every family member contribute to the plan. Kogan said that approach helps everyone feel as if they have a hand in making the plan. That ensures, she said, that your kids will buy into helping out. Regular family meetings to tweak the plan allows you to address other issues such as bedtime. \xe2\x80\x9cFamily meetings," Kogan said, "also help to create a strong family culture." Cashing In Children can start earning their piggy bank money at an early age. (photo: Jupiterimages/Goodshoot/Getty Images) Maturity can also trigger other adjustments, such as how much allowance the child gets. Stephanie Coffin, parenting expert with Bellies, Babies & Beyond, an online parenting resource, thinks it should happen as soon as the child is physically able to do more around the house. "Teaching children the harder they work the more allowance they will get is an invaluable goal for when they are adults,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Before giving out raises, Coffin recommends looking at the big picture. How long will they get an allowance? Will there need to be a raise every year or two years? How much will you be able to afford in five years? While your children should complete some chores without monetary rewards, adding extra incentives and raising allowances for tougher work may motivate them to do more without resistance. Stacey Glaesmann, a Texas-based licensed professional counselor, recommends making chores part of the family\xe2\x80\x99s normal routine at an early age. \xe2\x80\x9cSmall children usually want to help Mommy or Daddy around the house,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a great time to introduce the concept of chores and start rewarding the child with praise for completing tasks.\xe2\x80\x9d It\'s only natural for children to resist chores as they get older. That\'s yet another reason Glaesmann thinks you should get them in the habit early. \xe2\x80\x9cFor older kids, it is essential to figure out what the most effective reward for that particular child is when adding responsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt could be money, but it could also be going somewhere or seeing a certain friend.\xe2\x80\x9d Pushing Back Bedtimes Increasing your child\'s bedtime in small increments will help him adjust. (photo: Thomas Northcut/Lifesize/Getty Images) Bedtimes may be a point of tension if your child craves more freedom. Glaesmann recommends setting new bedtimes by taking cues from your child. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the parent is putting the child to bed at a certain time and the child is lying there awake for another hour, then it\xe2\x80\x99s probably time to let him stay up later,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, if the child exhibits bad behavior in the evenings, then letting him stay up longer will only reinforce the behavior. These issues involve a lot of parental instinct.\xe2\x80\x9d Lutton says behavior and maturity level both play a role in how late a child should be able to stay up. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you begin to notice your child having trouble falling asleep or waking up extremely early in the morning, you may want to try and let his bedtime be later,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. It may help to test the waters on weekends. If you let your child stay up a little later on a Friday or Saturday night, wake him up at the same time you would for a school day and have him do the same school day routines. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will be able to notice if your child is ready to stay up later by his actions and attitude throughout the day,\xe2\x80\x9d Lutton said. Adjusting bedtime in small increments could also help your child adapt to his newfound freedom. "It is smart to start to slowly increase bedtime to see how your child reacts," Lutton said. "You will know best if your child is too tired the next day and his bedtime should stay constant."

Android App: Electronics CB Radio Repair \xc2\xa9 The Fix-It Club. All rights reserved. Enter part or model #: << prev | 1 | 2 | 3 | next>> CB radios have been quietly popular for 30 years. When they first came on the scene, CB radios were liberating. They gave housewives, bored commuters, and students of human nature a new language: CB. "Ten-four" became an abused term. After the wild interest moved on to the Internet chat rooms, CB continued to serve its initial purpose: two-way communication on a budget. Here\'s how to fix a CB, good buddy. How Does It Work? Citizens band radios are miniature receivers and transmittersthat fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Work on the transmitter components should be done only by an FCC radiotelephone-licensed service person. A citizens band (CB) radio is both a receiver and a transmitter. A radio receiver is an electronic device that receives audio signals through an antenna, then amplifies and sends the sound to speakers. A transmitter does the opposite: it takes microphone (a reverse speaker) signals, converts them into electronic signals, and distributes them via an antenna. CB radios have 40 channels on which you can speak and/or listen. Some, such as channel 9, are set aside for special purposes (emergency assistance), but most are open to whatever you want to talk about. Mobile radios and mobile telephones work approximately the same way. What Can Go Wrong? Mobile CB radios, those installed in cars and trucks, run on car battery power. Base stations are corded radio transmitters and receivers. A battery or cord may need replacing. Many CBs have fuses that can be replaced, often from the back of the unit. Contacts can be bent of corroded. Controls and switches may be dirty. Antennas can break or become disconnected. Because CB radios transmit electronic signals, they come under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission. You\'ll need an FCC technician\'s license to work on a CB or mobile radio, other than a few tasks that can\'t impact transmission. Cleaning a CB is okay, as is replacing an antenna. And you can replace a Fuse. << prev | 1 | 2 | 3 | next>> Can\'t Find It?\xe2\x80\x83 Return to Top of Page Electronics Fix-It Guides Repair Resources \xc2\xa9 Copyright 2003 - 2013 by Fix It Club\xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0 Site Map \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0 About \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0 Fix-It Club Parts \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0 Fix-It Club Tools \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0 Fix-It Bookclub \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0 Webmaster \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0 Privacy \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0 Resources \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0 Advertise Other Mulligan Press websites: Interactive Fix-It Club , DontKnowCars.com , DontKnowRemodeling.com , DontKnowMoving.com , DontKnowFloors.com , SolarHomeGuides.com , CottageIncome.com , Mulligan Aviation websites .

PREAMBLE The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document\'s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work\'s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public. A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document\'s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document\'s license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version\'s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties\xe2\x80\x94for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements". 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation\'s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document\'s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/ . Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy\'s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document. 11. RELICENSING "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site. "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization. "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document. An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008. The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page: Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation License". If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the "with \xe2\x80\xa6 Texts." line with this: with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation. If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.

To report an error within an eBook (such as a missing word), please be sure to include the eBook number or specific filename or download link you used. Error reports are easiest to handle when they clearly indicate the context in which an error was found. Note that since Project Gutenberg includes many old titles, it is common for unusual spelling or arcane word uses to be used. If possible, check a printed source to verify whether an error exists, before reporting it. Messages to the errata list generate an automatic response that your report was received. Any errata/bug/typo report is welcome! There is additional guidance in the FAQ on how to prepare errata reports so they are easiest for the Project Gutenberg team to handle. Start with FAQ #R.26 on how to report typos. Newsletter subscriptions at lists.pglaf.org Newsletter subscriptions. Sign up for the weekly or monthly newsletter.

S'No Cost or Freedom? - Gutenberg No Cost or Freedom? From Project Gutenberg, the first producer of free ebooks. Jump to: navigation , search The word free in the English language does not distinguish between free of charge and freedom . Free of charge means that you don\'t have to pay for the book you received. Freedom denotes that you may do as you like with the book you received. This distinction is immaterial if you just want to read a book privately, but it becomes of utmost importance if you want to work with the book: you are a teacher and want to use the book in class, you wrote a thesis about the book and want to distribute the book along with your thesis, you have a literary web site and want to distribute the book to your audience, or you are a writer and want to adapt the book for the stage. If the book you got is just free of charge , you may do none of the above things. You may not even make a copy of the book and give it to your best friend. But if the book you got is free as in freedom you may do anything you like with that book. Clearly free as in freedom beats free of charge . Fortunately almost all Project Gutenberg ebooks are free of charge and free as in freedom . Here are some real world examples of what people did with Project Gutenberg ebooks . A few Project Gutenberg ebooks are copyrighted. You can tell by reading the license inside the book. You may download a copyrighted book and give copies away, but might be limited in commercial uses and derivative works. Why are these books free? Copyright for most of these books has expired in the United States. (They may still be copyrighted in other countries). So anybody may make verbatim or non-verbatim copies of those works.

IBiblio is our main eBook distribution site, holds our Web pages, and offers a variety of supporting services. Sister Projects Project Gutenberg of Australia Project Gutenberg of Australia provides books which are in the public domain in Australia. As a general rule the works of authors who died before 1955 are in the public domain in Australia. Works by George Orwell (died 1950), Virginia Woolf (died 1941), and James Joyce (died 1941), just to name a few authors, are in the public domain in Australia. Of course, works which are in the public domain in Australia may remain copyrighted in other Countries, even for several decades. People may not download, or read online, such works if they are in a country where they are still under copyright. That still leaves a lot of readers out there to enjoy etexts of some of the greatest literary works of the twentieth century. Project Gutenberg of Australia also provides a list all of the Project Gutenberg etexts (from both the US and Australian Collections) which were written by Australians or which relate (although loosely) to Australia, and has an extensive collection of books by and about the land and sea explorers who opened up the continent to white settlement.

What are the "Etext/Ebook numbers" on the texts? 4.6 R.39. What do the month and year on the text mean? About Finding eBooks R.1. How can I find an eBook I\'m looking for? For PG books, the simplest way is to go to the Online Search page , type the Author or Title into the search form, press the "Search" button, and follow the choices. There also is a full-text search available. More finding and browsing options are available at the Online Catalog page . R.2. Can I get a complete list of Project Gutenberg eBooks? Yes. GUTINDEX.ALL is the raw list of files posted. When we post a book, the posting information contains title and author, eBook number, base filename and schedule year and month. For books after 10,000, it just contains title, author and eBook number, since that is all we need to find books after 10,000. This raw information goes into GUTINDEX.ALL. After posting, the text is automatically cataloged, with limited information. Later, our catalogers get to work and add more information \xe2\x80\x94 things like full title, subtitle, author birth and death dates, Library of Congress Classification, full filenames and sizes. When a book has been cataloged, it is entered onto the website database so that you can search for it. People who want to bypass the search on the website and find books themselves may want to use GUTINDEX.ALL, since it doesn\'t wait for the cataloging. GUTINDEX.ALL is updated weekly, usually on Fridays. R.3. How can I download a PG text without using the web catalog? We have to divide this question into two answers, for books up to 10,000, and books after 10,000, or reposted since we moved past 10,000. Books posted after 10,000 go into a new, simpler, naming scheme. Books REposted after we passed 10,000 (around November 2003) also use this scheme. We are reposting many older books, with improvements and corrections, all the time, and older books may also be reposted into the new scheme. You can see clearly from the line in GUTINDEX.ALL whether the book is in the old naming scheme or the new naming scheme. Where the line starts with a Month and Year, and contains a file-name template in square brackets, the book is still in the old scheme, for example: Feb 2005 Mike, by P. G. Wodehouse [mikewxxx.xxx] 7423 The line for the same book, in the new naming scheme, would omit the Month and Year, and the filename base, and look like: Mike, by P. G. Wodehouse 7423 Books after 10,000 \xe2\x80\x94 the new naming scheme To find a text with a number over 10,000, or one that has been reposted since we passed 10,000, you must know the eBook number. You can get this from GUTINDEX.ALL Once you know the number, you can find the directory containing all formats of it. Formally, the directory for the eBook will be contained in a hierarchy of directories, each one a single digit, being all the digits of the etext number except the last, in order. The name of the directory for the eBook itself will be the number of the eBook. But it\'s easier to see by example. The files for eBook number 10214 will be found in the directory 1/0/2/1/10214 on the download site you choose. So, for example, if you are downloading eBook 10214 from our main site by HTTP from http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/ , you can just go to http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/1/10214/ and download whichever of the formats you want. Or, instead of typing in the whole address, for numbers beginning with the digit "1", you can just go to http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/ and navigate down the list of directories. Books before 10,000 \xe2\x80\x94 the old naming scheme In short, just browse to: http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/ choose the schedule year of the text (newly-posted texts will usually be in the latest year) and look down the list to find the filename you\'re looking for. In general, you need to know: the address of an FTP site the schedule year of the text you want the basename of the text you want. The fastest and safest FTP site to use for this is ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org , which is the first of our two primary posting sites (the other being ftp://ftp.archive.org ). We post to these two sites, and then other sites copy from them at intervals, so with any FTP sites other than these two, the file may not be available immediately. You can get the schedule year and basename of the text from its line in GUTINDEX.ALL. Let\'s take an example. The file Mar 2004 The Herd Boy and His Hermit, by C. M. Yonge [#32][hrdbhxxx.xxx]5313 has been posted just a few hours ago as I write this. From the GUTINDEX entry, the schedule year is 2004, and the basename of the text is hrdbh. We divide our texts into directories (folders) based on the schedule year, so this eBook will be in the directory for 2004, which will be named something ending in /etext04. All the directories are named etext plus the last two digits of the year. (Somebody\'s going to have to change that convention in about 87 years from now!\xc2\xa0:-) We currently have directories starting at 90, running through the 90s and then 00, 01, 02, 03, 04. All eBooks produced before 1991 are in the /etext90 directory, so if you\'re looking for Dec 1971 Declaration of Independence [whenxxxx.xxx] 1 or Aug 1989 The Bible, Both Testaments, King James Version [kjv10xxx.xxx] 10 you should look in /etext90. As it happens, ibiblio supports both HTTP (web) and FTP access to the text, so we can just browse to http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/ and choose the 2004 directory from there. If you want to automate this, you could also use the more direct address ftp://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04/ The equivalent address for ftp.archive.org is ftp://ftp.archive.org/pub/etext/etext04/ Either way, we see a long page of files, in alphabetical order. Scroll down to the "H"s and look for hrdbh. We see four files with this basename: hrdbh10.txt hrdbh10.zip hrdbh10h.htm hrdbh10h.zip This means that both plain text and HTML formats are available, and you can choose to download them either zipped or uncompressed. See this FAQ entry for more detail about conventions for filenames . The main thing you need to know is that any file beginning with hrdbh is some format or edition of this book. Finally, all you have to do is click on the format you want to download. R.4. You don\'t have the eBook I\'m looking for. Can you help me find it? Sorry, no. We can suggest (see below) some other places to look for publicly accessible books on the Net, but we can\'t do the search for you. R.5. Where else can I go to get eBooks? The Online Books Page specializes in creating a list of all books on-line from any source. Searching there is a good place to start. If you\'re looking for commercial books, like current textbooks or bestsellers, you\'re not likely to find them here, since recent books are not in the public domain. For these, you should look for commercial booksellers on the Net \xe2\x80\x94 any search engine will direct you to some if you enter search terms like "shop ebook". R.6. I see some eBooks in several places on the Net. Do different people really re-create the same eBooks? It does happen, but mostly by accident. Anyone experienced in eBook creation will first search the usual places to see whether anyone else has already transcribed the book they\'re interested in. If it has been transcribed, they will not duplicate the effort. Etexts that are in the public domain very often float around the Net for years \xe2\x80\x94 stored in a gopher server here, posted to Usenet there, held on someone\'s local computer for a year or two and then reformatted as HTML and uploaded to a web site somewhere else. And this is good, because we want texts to be copied as widely as possible. Public domain eBooks are fair game for anyone to copy, correct, mark up, package and post: that\'s what being in the public domain means. Project Gutenberg eBooks are often quickly copied and reformatted, and posted on other sites like Blackmask Online and Steve Sakoman\'s site at http://www.sakoman.net/ . Unfortunately the Blackmask Online website is down due to a lawsuit about the copyright of the Doc Savage books. If you find an eBook in many different places, the odds are good that it came from one original source, and was copied around. It does sometimes happen that people duplicate the transcription of books already made into text. Sometimes it\'s because they didn\'t find the version already made. Sometimes they have a different edition, and want to transcribe that. Mostly, though, we all try not to do more work than we have to. About Using the Web Site R.7. Why couldn\'t I reach your site? (or: Why is your site slow?) There may be a bottleneck somewhere else between you and the site. If at first you don\'t succeed, don\'t tell us, just try, try again. The correct address is: http://www.gutenberg.org/ R.8. I get an error when I try to download a book. Many FTP sites throughout the world hold the whole Project Gutenberg archive of texts. An FTP site is just a computer on the Internet that specializes in holding files for download and sending them to people on request. You can find a list of FTP sites that hold Gutenberg texts at http://www.gutenberg.org/MIRRORS.ALL . When you\'re searching or browsing for titles and authors, you\'re on this Project Gutenberg site, but if you choose one of the mirrors, or another method of downloading, when you click on the book to download it, you are connected to an FTP (or HTTP) site. At the time you click on the filename, your browser contacts an FTP site and tries to download the file from there. If you get an error, it could be because the FTP site is busy, or because there\'s a network traffic bottleneck between you and that FTP site, or because the text you\'re looking for is missing from that FTP site. Usually, the easiest solution is to choose another FTP site to download your text from. Go to the Search page, choose a different FTP site, and search again for your text. Tip: You should always try to choose the FTP site closest to you. Not only are you helping to minimize Net traffic by choosing a nearby site, but your file will download faster! If all else fails, note the year and the filename of the book you want, if it\'s below number 10,000, or its number, if above 10,000, choose an FTP site from this list and click on one of them. Then browse your way through the listings to the file you want. For example, if you find Lady Susan by Jane Austen, you will see that it was published by Gutenberg in 1997, and its filename is lsusn10.txt, so browse to one of the FTP sites, choose the directory called /etext97 and click (or right-click and Save, depending on your browser) on the file lsusn10.txt. Or, in the case of Clarissa, Volume 6 by Richardson, which is #11364, you will find it in the directory /1/1/3/6/11364 R.9. I searched for a book I know is in Project Gutenberg, but got no results. First go to the Advanced Search page. Sometimes you may miss in searching because of alternative spellings, so try searching separately using just one word in Author or Title. Read the Search Tips. If that fails, you can Browse through the site catalog. Let\'s say you\'re looking for The Wandering Jew by Eugene Sue. Go to the Online Catalog page. Once on this page, click on: "S" in "Authors:" You should now see a list of all of the Authors whose last name starts with "S". Scroll down till you find the direct links to the Sue, Eugene works. Click on the work you are interested to, then click on the file link found on the page you were brought to, Etext 3350 when selecting the work, as immediately above. On this page, above the excerpt, there are download links: Click on the link of your choice - plain text or zipped, and from ibiblio.org or other. If you choose one of the mirrors, you are then brought to a new page, asking you to select an "Download site". Further details on how and why to choose an "FTP Site" are available on this page. Select a site, and the file will be downloaded, or offered for download, depending on which format you selected and which browser you use. If you can\'t find your text either way, the book has not been cataloged. If you know that the book has been posted recently, and maybe hasn\'t made it into the catalog yet, read: How can I download a PG text without using the web catalog? If even this doesn\'t help, don\'t despair! We don\'t have it, but it may be elsewhere on the Web. Go to the major search engines and try there. You can also try looking in the Book Search section of The Online Books Page , and if you have no luck with that, you might be able to find it listed as being In Progress somewhere on their Books In Progress and Requested page. R.10. Can I copy your website, or your website materials? No. Keeping the PG site updated with the latest e-text releases is an ongoing job, and our experience is that people, however well-intentioned, do not keep copies up to date. We want there to be one clear source for people seeking the latest Project Gutenberg information, and we think that having a lot of out-of-date copies and partial copies scattered around the net would be a Bad Thing. We welcome mirrors and copies of our e-texts, in new FTP sites (see: Can I become an FTP mirror? ), but the main web site itself is copyrighted and may not be copied. R.11. Your site doesn\'t look right in my browser. I clicked on a button, and nothing happened. We take a lot of trouble to ensure that our website uses only valid, standard HTML, and we\'re not even slightly tempted to use glitzy features that look good in one browser but don\'t work in another, so we can promise you that our site is not the problem. If you actually clicked on a button, like the Search button, and nothing happened, you might be behind a proxy or web filter that doesn\'t like you making POST requests. If you have a web filter switched on, turn it off, reload the page and try again. R.12. What does that thing about "mirror sites" mean? Our texts are not actually held on the website. The website just holds an index; the files themselves are held on many sites throughout the world, called FTP sites. When you have found the book you\'re looking for, and you make that final click to get it, you\'re not actually talking to our website any more \xe2\x80\x94 you are transferred to the FTP site you selected. Some FTP sites are near you; some are far away. Some may be faster than others, even if they are about the same distance; some may have temporary technical problems. You should usually select the FTP site nearest you. If you find you\'re having problems with that one, you can select another. R.13. What exactly is an FTP site anyway? FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, one of the oldest and most reliable protocols of the internet. This is the method by which a file can be copied from one computer to another. We now have some HTTP (web) sites containing eBooks as well, including our main site at http://www.gutenberg.org/ . You can use either HTTP or FTP. An FTP site, or FTP server, is a computer that holds files that people can upload and download. In the case of PG, the Posting Team upload our texts when they\'re ready to two main FTP servers, ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org and ftp://ftp.archive.org , which serve as our master copies. Other FTP sites around the world automatically download the files from these master sites, so they have a full set of PG publications for you to download. Because they only check for updates and new files at intervals, some FTP sites may be a day or two behind. Some FTP sites don\'t have space available for everything, so they may hold only the zipped versions of the files. But most FTP sites will have the entire PG collection. These are called FTP "mirrors", since they are a copy of the original. Many FTP sites exist that offer a full PG mirror but are not on our FTP sites list. Commonly, these are in schools, where they serve the local students, but don\'t have enough bandwidth to offer downloads to worldwide users. R.14. Can I become an FTP mirror? Yes! We\'re always looking for more FTP mirrors. If you manage an FTP site with 100 GB or so of free space, please check our Contact Information page and contact the appropriate person, who will make the arrangements for you. R.15. Can I make a private FTP mirror for my school, library or organization? Yes. We like all FTP mirrors to be open to as many people as possible, but we know that not all schools have the resources to be a public mirror, so we welcome all mirrors. And anyway, you don\'t even have to ask, because we don\'t control what happens to our texts once we post them! R.16. When I clicked on the file I want, nothing happened. When you select a file for download, your request goes to the FTP site you selected, not to our website. If the FTP site you selected is having problems, or if there is the Net version of a traffic jam between you and it, you may have problems downloading. Select a different FTP site (see: What does that thing about "mirror sites" mean? ) and try again. R.17. How many texts are downloaded through the web site? Go to the Top 100 Page . R.18. What are the most popular books? Go to the Top 100 Page . These numbers vary a lot. When a movie based on a classic is released, downloads of that eBook go through the roof! About Downloading and Using Project Gutenberg eBooks R.19. Should I download a ZIP or a TXT file? If you know how to unzip a file, then downloading the zip is faster. For some non-text eBooks that contain multiple files, like HTML with included images, only a zip file may be available. For some other formats, like MP3 or MPEG, there may not be a zipped version available because the native format of the file is already compressed enough that zipping it doesn\'t save much. R.20. I\'ve got a ZIP file. What do I do with it? Unzip it. If you want a free program, you could try the open source Info-Zip software available at http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/tools/zip/info-zip/ for Mac, MS-DOS, Unix, Windows and just about everything else you might have. If you want a commercial program, PKZIP from http://www.pkware.com and WinZip from http://www.winzip.com are among many popular shareware utilities that allow you to unzip files. Mac-users using Stuffit Expander may like to set a preference (File / Preferences / Cross Platform) to "Convert text files to Macintosh format \xe2\x80\xa6 When a file is known to contain text". This gets rid of strange characters (linefeeds), which are not wanted on a Mac, at the beginnings of lines. MacZip is another free program for Macs. Mac users can also try ZipIt or other shareware programs available from the Info-Mac archives, e.g. from ftp://mirrors.aol.com/pub/info-mac/_Compress_&_Translate/ . R.21. I tried to unzip my file, but it said the file was corrupt, or damaged. The chances are that it didn\'t download correctly. Try downloading it again. If you don\'t succeed the second time, try downloading the unzipped version. R.22. I see gibberish onscreen when I click on a book. To save download time, our etexts are stored in zipped form as well as text form. Zipped files are smaller, and take less time to transfer to your computer, but you need a program to unzip them. If you try to view a zipped file directly, it looks like gibberish. You can recognize zipped files easily because their filenames end in .zip. If this happens, either make sure you\'re asking your browser to Save the file rather than display it (often, you right-click the file and choose Save) or else click on the version of the file that ends in .txt instead of .zip. You don\'t need a zip program to view .txt files. Looking at a zip rather than a text file is by far the most common reason for this problem, but there are some others. If you\'re quite sure that you\'re not looking at a zip file, then it could be that the file you downloaded is in a character set that your viewer doesn\'t recognize, like Big-5 [V.78] for Chinese texts, or Unicode [V.77]. If this is the case, you will have to find a viewer that works on your computer for the specified character set. We may also have an ASCII version of the same text available for you \xe2\x80\x94 we do try to have ASCII versions for everything [G.17], but some languages, like Chinese, just cannot be sensibly expressed in ASCII. If you can see most of the characters, enough to be able to make out the text, but there are regular gibberish characters, black squares, empty boxes or obviously missing characters scattered about through words, then you are probably looking at an "8-bit" text [V.79], with accented characters, and your viewer doesn\'t handle the character set. See the FAQ "I can read the text file, but a few characters appear as black squares, or gibberish" [R.31]. If there are a very few gibberish characters, black squares or obviously missing characters in the text, then it\'s likely that this was intended to be a 7-bit text, but a few 8-bit characters like the British pound symbol or accented letters slipped through. R.23. Can I download and read your books? Yes. That\'s what Project Gutenberg is all about \xe2\x80\x94 making texts available free to everyone! R.24. What am I allowed to do with the books I download? Most Project Gutenberg e-texts are in the public domain. You can do anything you like with these \xe2\x80\x94 you can re-post them on your site, print them, distribute them, translate them to other languages, convert them to other formats, or redistribute them in unchanged form. However, if you distribute versions under the Project Gutenberg trademark, we do impose some conditions, which are explained in the header and/or footer in each text. Some Project Gutenberg e-texts have copyright restrictions. You can still download and read these, but you may not be allowed to reproduce, modify or distribute them. When browsing or searching on the site, you will see these copyright-restricted texts indicated in the listings. For fuller information about them, download the e-text and read the header or footer of the file, which will spell out the conditions in detail. R.25. Does Project Gutenberg know who downloads their books? No, and we don\'t want to! Like any Internet transfer, our sites have to know the IP addresses that contact them; without that, no communication is possible. But we do not trace, hold or examine them beyond what is necessary to deal with any problems or maintain logs or statistics. We never identify IP addresses with people. Further, we encourage people, sites, schools around the world to mirror, or copy, our texts to their sites. Once that happens, we have no control over them, and we never have any idea who or even how many people access them after that. Even further, we encourage people to distribute the texts on disks, CDs, paper, and any other storage format they can find. We encourage them to convert the texts to other formats, and share them. For most people reading this, anonymity is probably not an issue, but you may live in a place or time where reading Paine, or Voltaire, or the Bible, or the Koran, is considered suspicious or even subversive. We don\'t know who you are, and what we don\'t know, we can\'t tell. Currently (2004), by means of DRM (Digital Rights/Restrictions Management) many commercial publishers can make a list of exactly who is reading which of their eBooks. We don\'t know, and we don\'t want to know. R.26. I\'ve found some obvious typos in a Project Gutenberg text. How should I report them? The first thing to remember is that the people who actually make the corrections you suggest are very experienced, and are used to seeing lots of different types of errata reports. So the exact format of your report isn\'t really very important \xe2\x80\x94 just get the report to us in any clear form that we can understand. Beyond that, here are some tips to avoid misunderstandings. It\'s always helpful if you report the full title, etext number, year and filename of the text you are correcting. We have multiple editions and versions of some texts, like Homer\'s "Odyssey", and unless you tell us exactly what text you mean, we may have to spend some time searching and guessing. Especially, please check and report the exact filename of the text. It is amazingly common for people to report problems with abcde10.txt, when abcde11.txt is already posted, and has these and other errors already fixed. When there are only a few errors, it\'s usually easiest to cut and paste the line or lines where the error is into your e-mail, with your comment. It can also be useful to give the line number of the place where the error is, and some people who check texts regularly do this. If this seems natural to you, do it; if it doesn\'t, don\'t. An ideal report for a typical errata list might look like: Title: The Odyssey, by Homer Translated by Butcher & Lang April, 1999 [Etext #1728] File: dyssy08.txt Line 884: back Telemachus, who bas now resided there for a month. "bas" should be "has" Line 1491: Ithaca yet stands. But I wouldask thee, friend, concerning "would" and "ask" are run together here Line 1563: in his father\'s seat and the elders gave place to him This is the end of a paragraph, and needs a period at end. Line 15346-7: \'Hearken to me now, ye men of Ithaca, to the will say. Through your own cowardice, my friends, have I think there is something missing between "the" and "will" But the following would get the job done as well: In Homer\'s Odyssey, translated by Butcher and Lang, from /etext99, file dyssy08.txt, I found the following errors: Telemachus, who bas now resided change "bas" to "has" But I wouldask thee, "would ask" run together and the elders gave place to him needs period ye men of Ithaca, to the will say. line missing between "the" and "will"? Where there are more than, say, 50 changes, it may be easiest all round just to submit a corrected version of the file. However, if you do this, please do not re-wrap the paragraphs unless it is absolutely necessary (and I can\'t think of a case where it might be, since we can re-wrap texts too); we need to check your suggestions before reposting, and if the file is very different, it is difficult and time-consuming for us to find your real changes among all of the changes in the lines. Instead just add a comment in your mail like "I think this text needs rewrapping." If you are a regular, and have used any of the standard Gutenberg tools like Gutcheck or Guiguts to find errors, please don\'t list these in your mail. We will be running gutcheck and a basic spellcheck as standard on every updated text that we repost, and it just wastes time to have lots of duplicates. You might just mention something like "gutcheck finds a lot of bad quotes"; we\'ll know what to do from there. Please concentrate your report on the errors that we won\'t find, or might miss, with a standard automated scan. R.27. I\'ve found some obvious typos in a Project Gutenberg text. Who should I report them to? The Posting Team, who post the books, also make the corrections, and ultimately, the corrections need to go to them. Visit the Contact Us page for the current email address of the errata team (it is changed periodically to cut down on spam). Many producers put their e-mail addresses in their texts, specifically so that readers can contact them when errors are found. If you see that in your text, you should try to contact the producer first. This is especially true if the corrections aren\'t obvious, as in the case of missing words. The producer is likely to have the original book, and will probably be able to confirm your corrections without visiting a library. If the book needs the corrections, the producer can then notify the Posting Team. If you get no response from the producer, or if there is no e-mail address listed, or if the corrections are small and obvious, you should send them to the email address for reporting errors listed on the Contacts Page where members of the posting team will deal with them. R.28. I\'ve reported some typos. What will happen next? This varies wildly. Sometimes, you may just get a response e-mail in a day or three saying thanks, and that we\'ve fixed the typo. This is normal when you\'ve just reported one or a few obvious typos. Where there is some text missing, or the changes you suggest are otherwise not obvious, we may have to find someone with an eligible copy of the book to confirm the changes, and that might take time. Normally, you will get an e-mail explaining that within a week. Sometimes, even though you\'ve noticed only one or two small typos, one of the Posting Team who was looking at it may find many more, and decide that the whole text needs to be re-proofed. This may also take time. If the text needs a lot of changes, we may post a new EDITION [R.35] of it, with a new filename: e.g. abcde10.txt may become abcde11.txt. In this case, you will receive a copy of the e-mail sent to the posted list announcing the new file. Our current rule of thumb is that we create a new edition when we make twelve significant changes, but we judge each on a case-by-case basis, and especially will usually not make a new edition if the original was posted recently. R.29. I\'ve got the text file, and I can read it, but it seems to be double-spaced or it has control characters like ^J or ^M at the end of every line. This is most often seen on Mac or Linux. If you want to dig into why this effect happens, see the FAQ "Why use a CR/LF at end of line?" [V.85]. Perhaps viewing it in a different editor or viewer will help, but it\'s usually easiest just to globally replace all of the control characters (if you see them) with nothing, or to replace all double line-ends with single line-ends. R.30. When I print out the text file, each line runs over the edge of the page and looks bad. If you have a file ending in .txt from Project Gutenberg, it is usually formatted with about 70 characters per line, and with a Carriage Return/Line Feed pair (also known as a "Hard Return" or a "Paragraph Mark") at the end of every line. This is the most widely accepted format for text files, but it\'s not ideal on all computers and all programs. 70 characters per line means that if you are using an unusually large or small font to print it, lines may wrap around or not reach across the page. The hard return means that on some systems, the lines may appear double-spaced. Unfortunately, we can\'t advise you how best to format texts on all systems, mostly because we don\'t know every system! Here are a couple of tips you might try: If your font is too big or too small, try setting the font to Courier size 10 or Times size 12. It may not be ideal, but it mostly works. In a word processor, you may be able to remove the Hard Returns, but beware! if you remove too many, the whole text will become one paragraph. One common formula for removing the HRs goes like this: First, all paragraphs and separate lines should be separated by two HRs, so that you can see one blank line between them. Where they aren\'t, as in the case of a table of contents or lines of verse, add the extra HRs to make them so. Replace All occurrences of two HRs with some nonsense character or string that doesn\'t exist in the text, like ~$~. Replace All remaining HRs with a space. Replace your inserted string ~$~ with one HR. R.31. I can read the text file, but a few characters appear as black squares, or gibberish. The text is using some character set that your editor or viewer isn\'t. For example, the text is using ISO-8859-1, and your viewer is using Codepage 850 \xe2\x80\x94 or vice versa. You can see the plain ASCII characters, but non-ASCII characters like accented letters display as nonsense. Look at the top of the file for a clue to the character set encoding: if it\'s there, it may help you to find which editor, or font, or viewer you should be using. R.32. Can I get a handheld device for reading PG texts? Which device should I get? To read eBooks on a handheld, you need three things: the eBook content itself (which you can get from PG and other sites), a device (which I will sometimes call a PDA, even though technically, the RocketBook isn\'t a PDA) and the reader software that runs on the PDA. In mid-2002, there are three main families of handheld devices people use for reading eBooks: Palms, Pocket PCs and RocketBooks (or their successor, REB1100s). In general, it is possible to use any of these in combination with any common type of personal computer. Palms are very common, especially when you count not just the Palm http://www.palmone.com/us/ itself, but PalmOS-based devices from other manufacturers, like: the Franklin eBookman http://www.franklin.com/ebookman/ the Handspring Visor http://www.handspring.com the Sony Cli\xc3\xa9 http://www.sony.com Because of the number of makers of PalmOS-based devices, you can buy them with lots of combinations of features \xe2\x80\x94 color screen, audio, different memory sizes. Of course, Palms have other applications besides eBook reading. Palms are the smallest and most portable of the three classes, and tend to have the best battery life for travelling, but they also have the smallest screen. Just about all reader software will run on Palms, except the Microsoft Reader, which runs only on Pocket PCs, but you don\'t need the Microsoft Reader for Project Gutenberg eBooks. In Pocket PCs, the Compaq iPaq http://www.hp.com and the Dell Axim http://www.dell.com are by far the most common at the end of 2003. More expensive and bulkier than a Palm, they have a bigger screen. Like the Palms, they can perform many functions besides reading eBooks. Only Pocket PCs can support the Microsoft Reader, but this is not necessary for reading Project Gutenberg eBooks. The RocketBook, and its successor the Gemstar REB1100, are quite different from the others. These were built specifically for reading eBooks, and do not have additional functions. They are not, technically, PDAs. Their screens are bigger, and excellent for reading, but do not offer color. They also don\'t offer a choice of readers \xe2\x80\x94 the dedicated reader is built-in to the device. Both of them require the eBooks you load to be formatted for their reader, and files made for them usually have the extension .rb for RocketBook. The REB1100 did not come with the RocketLibrarian, which is the program you run on your PC to turn an etext into a RocketBook file, but people are still making .rb files, and the RocketLibrarian is still available and popular among an enthusiastic group of Rocket users. (The REB1200 is entirely different from the REB1100, and, as far as we know, PG etexts cannot easily be transferred to it.) In late 2003, Gemstar discontinued their eBook reader range, but there are many still around. In summary, the Rocket/REB1100 is a dedicated reader, with a good screen, but limited to what it does. Palms are relatively cheap and common, with a wide range of options, and the capacity to function as PDAs as well. They can run all common readers except the Microsoft one. The iPaq http://www.hp.com has a good color screen, but is bulkier than a Palm, and can run lots of readers, including the Microsoft one, but not all Palm readers are available for Pocket PC. Like Palms, the iPaq can do other jobs besides displaying eBooks. Different people make different choices among these for reading their eBooks, and they all work well; it\'s a matter of personal taste. How can I read a PG eBook on my Palm? These steps work for all devices running the Palm OS. Install the free Plucker Viewer on your Palm Download the eBook in the "plucker" format to your desktop Sync the plucker file to the Palm using your favorite desktop application How can I read a PG eBook on my PDA (not Palm)? To read a book on your PDA, you need to get the file into a format that your reader software understands. Each PDA reader program will work only with a specific format of file. Some will read several formats, but, in general, it\'s a jungle of competing options. Unless you use a Rocket or REB1100, you will need to install at least one reader program, and many veteran readers install two or three to deal with different formats. There are many of them available. One of the most used is the Mobipocket Reader . Further, the process may be different depending on which reader software you\'re using. Each format that a reader understands has one or more converter programs that run on your PC, and turn the plain text file into that format. So in general, you have to: Download the PG text Edit the text for the layout the converter wants (often HTML). Use the converter to create a file of the format the reader wants. Transfer the converted file to your PDA. If all this sounds too complicated, remember that many people take and convert PG texts into many formats, and offer them for download from their sites. Of course, there is no guarantee that someone will have converted the particular eBook you want, but there are lots of options. Try Blackmask , which lists thousands of texts already converted for Mobipocket, iSilo, RocketBook and the Microsoft Reader. There are many other sites that serve pre-converted PG texts. MemoWare is also a useful resource for converted eBooks, and has lots of information, including an excellent map of the readers and formats jungle . Steve Sakoman\'s site at http://www.sakoman.net/ takes plain texts from PG and produced automated conversions to HTML and PalmDOC PDB. If you\'re "rolling your own", you\'ll probably need to convert our plain texts to HTML at some point, because a lot of converters require HTML as input, and this is a common theme in readers\' explanations of how they get texts onto their PDAs. Don\'t panic! You don\'t have to be a HTML wizard to do this \xe2\x80\x94 in fact, you don\'t need to know anything about HTML at all! Usually, it\'s just a matter of removing some line ends and Saving As HTML. You won\'t get a lot of fancy markup, or images out of thin air, but you will get the book. One of the main things you usually have to do in making HTML is unwrap the lines. If you\'re making your HTML manually, this is usually done by replacing two paragraph marks with some nonsense marker like @@Z@@, replacing all single paragraph marks with a space, and replacing the nonsense marker with a paragraph mark. After unwrapping, the text can just be Saved As HTML. This has the drawback that lines that shouldn\'t be wrapped \xe2\x80\x94 like poetry, tables or letter headings, will be wrapped. You may have to go through the text and add extra line breaks for these. There are some applications that specifically assist with auto-converting text into HTML: GutenMark http://www.sandroid.org/GutenMark was specifically written for the purpose, and knows enough about PG conventions to do a very good job.

S'The CD and DVD Project - Gutenberg The CD and DVD Project From Project Gutenberg, the first producer of free ebooks. Jump to: navigation , search Project Gutenberg periodically generates CD and DVD image files (ISO files) containing books from the collection. When downloaded, they can be used to make a CD or DVD using a CD or DVD writer. Note that you will need a dual layer burner in order to burn our dual layer DVD. If you\'d rather not burn a physical disc, the ISO files can also be mounted on most systems. Here are instructions for mounting our latest DVD under Linux , though these instructions should work for any of our ISOs. Please copy and give away these CDs and DVDs! Keep one for yourself, and give one to a friend \xe2\x80\xa6 or a library \xe2\x80\xa6 or a school. These CD and DVD compilations are copyrighted and licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 1.0 license . Individual files should be consulted for individual licenses, including the Project Gutenberg Trademark License ("small print") . Verbatim copies of the Project Gutenberg \'Best Of\' CD may be sold provided that 20% of the gross proceeds are donated to Project Gutenberg, however, none of the DVDs may be sold, as they contain some material which is copyrighted. These CD and DVD images (and the CDs and DVDs they can be used to create) should run on all computer systems. Many files on the DVDs are compressed using Zip; most modern computers (and many older ones as well) have an unzip program built-in, or you can find a free unzip program on the Internet for your computer.

The December 2003 DVD contains 9400 of our first 10,000 books. The July 2006 DVD contains over 17,000 books from our first 19,000 titles. The March 2007 Science Fiction Bookshelf CD contains most of our science fiction titles. The April 2010 (Dual Layer) DVD contains 29,500+ books. All of the books found on the 2003 CD can also be found on all of the DVDs and most of the files on the December 2003 DVD can be found on the July 2006 DVD. Likewise, most of the books on the July 2006 DVD can also be found on the April 2010 DVD. There are very few images on the discs, and no audio books. If these compilations are not to your liking, you can create your own CD or DVD image containing only the books you want. What the Discs do not Contain For the most part, the original copyright on the materials distributed by Project Gutenberg has expired. This means that most of the books on the discs are at least 80+ years old, and you will almost certainly not find information about computers, video games, or other topics that you may be studying in school (unless perhaps you are an English major studying at a liberal arts college). The materials on a Project Gutenberg disc will not substitute for the textbooks that you are required to purchase. (Even if you are an English major, your professor will likely assign a particular edition of the books you will read.) There is no information on Microsoft Windows, Linux, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii, or Sega DreamCast. You will not find any information on defeating copy protection or how you can obtain "warez." If you are looking for any of these things, please do not download or request copies of the Project Gutenberg discs. It would be a waste of our limited time and money. How to download The CD and DVD images are distributed as ISO files. One ISO file contains all of the data for one disc, so they tend to be large. these images may take some time when downloading via a modem or other slow connection. At 56K, the zipped versions of the CD ISOs could take up to 24 hours to download, and each single layer DVD will require about 11 days, with the dual layer DVD requiring about twice that. The time will of course be a fraction of that when downloading over a high-speed connection. Downloading Via BitTorrent BitTorrent is our recommended way to download the images. Not only does it tend to be quite fast, but it also insures that you receive an error-free copy of the files. In order to download via BitTorrent, you will need a BitTorrent Client. You can download the official BitTorrent client from http://www.bittorrent.com , or you can use one of the many other clients available on the internet. See here for a list and comparison of various BitTorrent clients . See here for more information about BitTorrent in general . Once you have BitTorrent installed, you only need the torrent file for the image you wish to download. You can Usually obtain these torrent files from The Project Gutenberg BitTorrent Tracker . You can also get the torrent files from the below links: The August 2003 CD The July 2006 DVD The March 2007 Science Fiction Bookshelf CD The April 2010 (Dual Layer) DVD Or, if your client supports magnet links, you might try the following: magnet:?xt=urn:btih:SMVFOYIXEKAC7DGLK3T4JFKA5S3EOOZR&dn=pg2003-08.zip&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fsnowy.arsc.alaska.edu%3A6969%2Fannounce \xe2\x80\x94 The August 2003 CD magnet:?xt=urn:btih:KR6A7743VOOKQWZOZQMPS5DORPFKPIZW&dn=pgdvd072006.iso&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fsnowy.arsc.alaska.edu%3A6969%2Fannounce \xe2\x80\x94 The July 2006 DVD magnet:?xt=urn:btih:PCHVSDZIU6M4YEAJVG3YBNSJ7VXQULUR&dn=PGSFCD-032007.zip&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fsnowy.arsc.alaska.edu%3A6969%2Fannounce \xe2\x80\x94 The March 2007 Science Fiction Bookshelf CD magnet:?xt=urn:btih:DKNULNDJWCFN4M7DIM7QK7XH4YYMJF5E&dn=pgdvd042010.iso&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fsnowy.arsc.alaska.edu%3A6969%2Fannounce \xe2\x80\x94 The April 2010 (Dual Layer) DVD Downloading Via Edonkey/Emule If you have a program which uses the Edonkey Protocol, you might try the following links: for the July 2006 DVD, ed2k://|file|pgdvd072006.iso|4626251776|F149537F97E9B2FF57A28712FA70CC6A|h=MAIUF5WXX3C5ZZ7C2SDKCNSGITLSODX2|/ for the December 2003 DVD, ed2k://|file|The.Project.Gutenberg.DVD.December.2003.Edition.pgdvd.iso|4139646976|02CEB6E1E07A0CDC98757134B0678B14|/ For the December 2003 CD, ed2k://|file|The.Project.Gutenberg.CD.August.2003.Edition.-.PG2003-08.zip|387828452|0485242D72E3B440D7D9FD61F0ED44DD|/ for the March 2007 Science Fiction Bookshelf CD, ed2k://|file|PGSFCD-032007.zip|154915573|E5EE354281E500B29BC29B61BDBBC26E|h=3P7ANYCATOMLK4IQTOONBKLOSLP7WDXR|/ If the above ed2k links are not clickable from your browser, you may need to copy and paste them into your edonkey aware application.

Public Domain Books These books are in the public domain in the United States and everybody \xe2\x80\x94 including Project Gutenberg and you \xe2\x80\x94 may read and distribute them.

A Project Gutenberg ebook is made out of two parts: the public domain book and the non public domain Project Gutenberg trademark and license. If you strip the Project Gutenberg license and all references to Project Gutenberg from the ebook, you are left with a public domain ebook. You can do anything you want with that. Copyrighted Books Some authors give Project Gutenberg permission to distribute their book(s). This permission does not automatically expand to include you. If you want to distribute a copyrighted ebook you found on PG, you have to contact the author and stipulate an agreement. N.B. The catalog will tell you if an ebook is copyrighted, but sometimes the catalog is wrong. Always look at the license inside the ebook to tell if it is copyrighted or not. Using the Project Gutenberg Trademark If you want to use the name Project Gutenberg anywhere in the ebooks you distribute or on the distribution medium or in advertising you have to obey these rules: you may only distribute verbatim copies of the ebooks. No changes are allowed to the ebook contents. (Though reformatting the ebook to a different file format is considered okay). If you charge money for the copies you distribute, you have to pay royalties to Project Gutenberg. You must refund your clients for defective copies or if they don\'t agree with the Project Gutenberg license. If you don\'t agree with any of the above mentioned restrictions, you may not use the Project Gutenberg trademark. You may still distribute the ebooks if you strip the Project Gutenberg license and all references to Project Gutenberg. The Full Project Gutenberg License in Legalese (normative) Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be renamed. Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks. Redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks. [*] This paragraph, after 1.C., is included only for copyrighted works. For those, you must contact the copyright holder before any non-free use or removal of the Project Gutenberg header.

S'Michael S. Hart - Gutenberg Michael S. Hart From Project Gutenberg, the first producer of free ebooks. Jump to: navigation , search Contents 1 Michael Stern Hart (1947-2011) 1.1 Obituary for Michael Stern Hart 1.1.1 Eulogy for Michael S. Hart 1.2 Message from Michael\'s Family 1.3 Read some of Michael\'s recent writings 1.4 Collection of Links Michael Stern Hart (1947-2011) Obituary for Michael Stern Hart Michael Stern Hart was born in Tacoma, Washington on March 8, 1947. He died on September 6, 2011 in his home in Urbana, Illinois, at the age of 64. His is survived by his mother, Alice, and brother, Bennett. Michael was an Eagle Scout (Urbana Troop 6 and Explorer Post 12), and served in the Army in Korea during the Vietnam era. Hart was best known for his 1971 invention of electronic books, or eBooks. He founded Project Gutenberg, which is recognized as one of the earliest and longest-lasting online literary projects. He often told this story of how he had the idea for eBooks. He had been granted access to significant computing power at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. On July 4 1971, after being inspired by a free printed copy of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, he decided to type the text into a computer, and to transmit it to other users on the computer network. From this beginning, the digitization and distribution of literature was to be Hart\'s life\'s work, spanning over 40 years. Hart was an ardent technologist and futurist. A lifetime tinkerer, he acquired hands-on expertise with the technologies of the day: radio, hi-fi stereo, video equipment, and of course computers. He constantly looked into the future, to anticipate technological advances. One of his favorite speculations was that someday, everyone would be able to have their own copy of the Project Gutenberg collection or whatever subset desired. This vision came true, thanks to the advent of large inexpensive computer disk drives, and to the ubiquity of portable mobile devices, such as cell phones. Hart also predicted the enhancement of automatic translation, which would provide all of the world\'s literature in over a hundred languages. While this goal has not yet been reached, by the time of his death Project Gutenberg hosted eBooks in 60 different languages, and was frequently highlighted as one of the best Internet-based resources. A lifetime intellectual, Hart was inspired by his parents, both professors at the University of Illinois, to seek truth and to question authority. One of his favorite recent quotes, credited to George Bernard Shaw, is characteristic of his approach to life: "Reasonable people adapt themselves to the world. Unreasonable people attempt to adapt the world to themselves. All progress, therefore, depends on unreasonable people." Michael prided himself on being unreasonable, and only in the later years of life did he mellow sufficiently to occasionally refrain from debate. Yet, his passion for life, and all the things in it, never abated. Frugal to a fault, Michael glided through life with many possessions and friends, but very few expenses. He used home remedies rather than seeing doctors. He fixed his own house and car. He built many computers, stereos, and other gear, often from discarded components. Michael S. Hart left a major mark on the world. The invention of eBooks was not simply a technological innovation or precursor to the modern information environment. A more correct understanding is that eBooks are an efficient and effective way of unlimited free distribution of literature. Access to eBooks can thus provide opportunity for increased literacy. Literacy, and the ideas contained in literature, creates opportunity. In July 2011, Michael wrote these words, which summarize his goals and his lasting legacy: \xe2\x80\x9cOne thing about eBooks that most people haven\'t thought much is that eBooks are the very first thing that we\'re all able to have as much as we want other than air. Think about that for a moment and you realize we are in the right job." He had this advice for those seeking to make literature available to all people, especially children: "Learning is its own reward. Nothing I can say is better than that." Michael is remembered as a dear friend, who sacrificed personal luxury to fight for literacy, and for preservation of public domain rights and resources, towards the greater good. This obituary is granted to the public domain by its author, Dr. Gregory B. Newby. Eulogy for Michael S. Hart As spoken by Newby at Michael\'s funeral, September 12 2011 (this sequence of words is granted to the public domain): "Rather than speak in whole sentences, which can be difficult at times like these, I will speak a series of words that characterize Michael. These words might help you to form your own memories of him. Friend. Visionary. Leader. Intellectual. Anti-Elitist. Digital Literati. Rebel. Frisbee Player. Hippie. Musician. Technician. Enthusiast. lover of Much and Many. Full of Passion. Scout. Veteran. Patriot. Pacifist. Humanist. Egalitarian. Educator. Man of the People. Builder. Maker. Speaker. Listener. Systems Analyst. Friend." Message from Michael\'s Family The family prepared a document with an image of Michael, "breaking down the bars of ignorance and illiteracy." The message is part of this PDF file and contains this text: Thank you for your kind thoughts at this time. Michael will be truly missed by his family \xe2\x80\x93 by his friends \xe2\x80\x93 and by the world\xc2\xa0!! Please keep breaking down the bars\xc2\xa0!!

S'How to Write a Twitter Bot using Google Scripts - Tutorial Technology Blog Home About How-to Guides Newsletter Windows 8 Internet , Google Docs , Twitter couch mode print story 08 mar 2013 How to Write a Twitter Bot in 5 Minutes This step-by-step tutorial explains how you can create your own Twitter bot using Google Scripts and the new Twitter API. The bot runs inside the Google cloud. Meet @DearAssistant , a Twitter bot that is like a online version of Siri. You can tweet your questions in plan English and the bot will reply with an answer. The Twitter bot is internally using Wolfram Alpha so there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole range of questions that it can answer. Here are some questions that people have asked @DearAssistant so far: How many calories are in Diet Coke? ( link ) When was Mahatama Gandhi born? ( link ) What is the distance between city A and city B ( link ) What is the price of Kindle Paperwhite ( link ) You can also ask the bot for word meanings, weather conditions, language translation, to convert between time zones, date calculations (how many days until Christmas) and more. Writing a Twitter Bot \xe2\x80\x93 The Basic Ingredients Writing a Twitter bot is surprisingly simple and you can get one up and running in 5 minutes. It helps if you know little bit of coding (simple JavaScript) but that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not a requirement for writing a basic Twitter bot. A bot is essentially a program that is always running in the background and whenever it encounters a command (tweets in this), it processes it (based on the text of the tweeet) and sends a reply to the tweeter in another tweet. Earlier, you would need a web server to run the bot while the bot itself would be written in languages like PHP, Perl or Python. That\xe2\x80\x99s complicated so we will use Google Scripts to write the Twitter bot and host it on our Google Drive. How to Write a Twitter Bot \xe2\x80\x93 Step by Step Step A: Setup a Twitter App ( screenshot ) Create a new account at Twitter that will become the bot. Then go to dev.twitter.com , sign-in with your new Twitter account and create a Twitter app. Give your app a name, description, website (any URL) and callback URL (https://spreadsheets.google.com/macros/). Agree to the terms, fill in the CAPTCHA and submit the form to create your first Twitter application. Once the Twitter app has been created, click the Settings tab and choose Read and Write under Application Type. This is important since we want the bot to read tweets as well as post tweets. Click the Update button to save your changes. Switch to the OAuth tool tab and make note of the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret. We will need these later in our Google Apps Script. Step B: Create a Wolfram Alpha App ( screenshot ) While the Twitter app will monitor and respond to tweets, the Wolfram App will be used to determine answers that users will be posing to your Twitter bot. Go to developer.wolfram.com, create an account and then choose \xe2\x80\x9cGet an App ID\xe2\x80\x9d to create your new app. [See update below] We will need this App ID in the Google Script. Remember that your free Wolfram Alpha App can only be used for a non-commercial purpose. Update [3/19/2013] \xe2\x80\x93 If you need to create a Twitter bot with Wolfram|Alpha, you should send an email to businessdevelopment@wolframalpha.com to discuss licensing. The @DearAssistant Twitter bot has permission from Wolfram to run 2,000 queries per month. Step C: Host the Twitter bot on Google Drive While you are signed-in to your Gmail account, go to script.google.com and then choose File -> Make a copy to duplicate the Twitter bot into your Google Drive. Edit the values of TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY, TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET, TWITTER_HANDLE (your new Twitter account) and WOLFRAM_API_ID \xe2\x80\x93 you know them all from the previous steps. Go to Run -> Start to initialize the Twitter bot. Say yes if the script requires you to authorize access to certain Google Script services. Go to Run -> Start to actually run the Twitter bot. It will show an \xe2\x80\x9cAuthorization Required\xe2\x80\x9d dialog and will redirect you to Twitter where you can grant the script access to your Twitter account. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. Close Google Scripts and your Twitter bot is now up and running, ready to take commands. As always, you are free to use, modify and distribute the source code with attribution.

Operator reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify, restrict or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. The Operator of the Service is SpyPig.com. 2. Registration, Password and Security Certain aspects of the Service may require You to first create an account, obtain a login name and password, and/or provide billing information.

If payment method is by credit card, then You agree that Operator may, at its option, accumulate charges incurred during the billing cycle and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each cycle. It is Your responsibility to keep Operator informed of changes to Your billing information (e.g., billing address, credit card/account number, and expiration date). You agree to remit payment for Services rendered in a way defined by Operator, or its agents if Your credit card issuer refuses any such charges.

Any modifications shall be effective upon the posting of the modified Terms of Use on Operator\'s Web site, whose URL is http://www.spypig.com/terms_of_use.php. You agree to review these Terms of Use periodically so that You are aware of any modifications. Your continued use of the Services shall be deemed Your acceptance of the modified Terms of Use. 13. Severability In the event that any provision of these Terms of Use is unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by applicable court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decision. 14. No Third Party Beneficiaries These Terms of Use shall not be deemed to create any rights in third parties. 15. Subcontractors In the course of providing the Services, Operator may retain independent contractors or assign or subcontract to or otherwise have any third party perform any or all of the Services at any time, provided that Operator shall continue to remain responsible for full performance of any such duties to the same extent as if it had performed the Services itself. Subcontractors who sell Services provided by Operator are called Resellers. Operator or its agent can contract with Resellers for special conditions to provide Service, registration, customer management, and payment collection, and such definitions do not always follow the above articles. 16. Entire Agreement These Terms of Use, including any applicable Privacy Policy Statement, completely and exclusively state the agreement between You and Operator regarding the subject matter, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, with respect to the subject matter of these Terms of Use. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 "I know you\'ve read my email!"\xe2\x84\xa2 Copyright \xc2\xa9 2013 SpyPig - Free Email Tracking System.

Click and hold down the right mouse button and then draw the mouse gesture you want performed. You can temporarily disable StrokeIt by holding down the Control key, or right clicking on the StrokeIt icon in the system tray. If you want to cancel a mouse gesture you\'ve already started drawing, simply left click. What mouse gestures does StrokeIt come pretrained to recognize? StrokeIt can recognized more than 80 unique mouse gestures. Who created StrokeIt? StrokeIt was written entirely by Jeff Doozan . How big is it?

PhoneGap Legends is a fantasy/RPG themed demo that leverages HTML DOM animation techniques and targets webkit browsers. I was able to get some really outstanding performance out of this example, so be sure to check out the video and read the details below. The name \xe2\x80\x9cPhoneGap Legends\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything; I just thought it sounded videogame-ish and appropriately fitting. PhoneGap Legends This game demo is an infinitely-scrolling top-view RPG themed game that is implemented entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is a scrolling background, enemy characters, HUD overlays, and of course, our \xe2\x80\x9cprotagonist\xe2\x80\x9d hero \xe2\x80\x93 all that\xe2\x80\x99s missing is a story, and general game mechanics like interacting with sprites. Again, I was able to get some *really outstanding performance* out of this sample, so I wanted to share, complete with source code, which you\xe2\x80\x99ll find further in this post (and I encourage you to share it too) . Take a look at the video below to see the game in action on a variety of devices. Every single bit of this is rendered completely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript \xe2\x80\x93 there are no native portions of the application. Disclaimer: This sample app is by no means a complete game or complete game engine. I\xe2\x80\x99ve implemented some techniques for achieving great performance within a PhoneGap application with game-themed content, but it still needs additional game mechanics. I also wrote this code in about 2 days \xe2\x80\x93 it needs some additional cleanup/optimization before use in a real-world game. Source Full source code for this demo application is available on github. This code is provided as-is:\xc2\xa0 https://github.com/triceam/PhoneGap-Legends . I will be making a updates over the next few days in preparation for GDC next week, but for the most part, it is stable. Development Approach The PhoneGap Legends application was built following the performance tips that I posted earlier this month . The game is built so that it uses a game loop based upon requestAnimationFrame to perform all UI updates. This gives it a scheduled interval that is in sequence with the browser\xe2\x80\x99s redraw cycle. In general, the DOM is as shallow as possible for achieving the desired experience. All \xe2\x80\x9csprites\xe2\x80\x9d, or UI elements are basic DOM nodes with a fixed position and size. \xc2\xa0All DOM elements have an absolute position at 0,0 and leverage translate3d for their x/y placement. \xc2\xa0This is beneficial for 2 reasons: 1) It is hardware accelerated, and 2) there are very, very few reflow operations. \xc2\xa0Since all the elements are statically positioned and of a fixed size, browser reflow operations are an an extreme minimum. The background is made up a series of tiles that are repeated during the walk/movement sequence: Sprite Sheet for Background Tiles In the CSS styles, each tile is 256\xc3\x97256 square, with a background style that is defined for each \xe2\x80\x9ctype\xe2\x80\x9d of tile: .tile{ width: 256px; height:256px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top:0px; left:0px; background-repeat: repeat; background-clip:border-box; } .tile_0 { background: url(\'../images/background_tiles.png\'); background-position: 0px 0px;} .tile_1 { background: url(\'../images/background_tiles.png\'); background-position: 256px 0px;} .tile_2 { background: url(\'../images/background_tiles.png\'); background-position: 512px 0px;} .tile_3 { background: url(\'../images/background_tiles.png\'); background-position: 0px 256px;} .tile_4 { background: url(\'../images/background_tiles.png\'); background-position: 256px 256px;} The content displayed within each of the \xe2\x80\x9csprite\xe2\x80\x9d DOM elements is applied using sprite sheets and regular CSS background styles. Each sprite sheet contains multiple images, the background for a node is set in CSS, and the position for each image is set using the \xe2\x80\x9cbackground-position\xe2\x80\x9d css style. \xc2\xa0For example, the walking animation for the hero character is applied just by changing the CSS style that is applied to the \xe2\x80\x9chero\xe2\x80\x9d <div> element. Sprite Sheet for Hero There is a sequence of CSS styles that are used to define each state within the walking sequence: .hero_0_0{ background: url(\'../images/rpg_sprite_walk.png\'); background-position:0px 0px;} .hero_0_1{ background: url(\'../images/rpg_sprite_walk.png\'); background-position:0px 96px;} .hero_0_2{ background: url(\'../images/rpg_sprite_walk.png\'); background-position:0px 192px;} .hero_0_3{ background: url(\'../images/rpg_sprite_walk.png\'); background-position:0px 288px;} ... This game demo extensively uses translate3d for hardware accelerated composition. \xc2\xa0However, note that the 3d transforms are all applied to relatively small elements, and are not nested. All of the \xe2\x80\x9ctextures\xe2\x80\x9d are well below the max texture size across all platforms (1024\xc3\x971024), and since it use sprite sheets and reusable CSS styles, there are relatively few images to load into memory or upload to the GPU.

This may be the best way to stream your PC games to your tablet. Andrew Cunningham In practically every one of its major press conferences since last year\'s GPU Technology Conference, Nvidia has reminded us that they want to virtualize the graphics processor. The company wants to take it out of the computer on your lap or on your desk and put it into a server somewhere without you noticing the difference. It introduced the concept at GTC 2012. Then over the course of the next year, Nvidia unveiled the actual graphics cards that would enable this tech, started selling them to partners, and also stuck them in Nvidia Grid-branded servers aimed at both gamers and businesses . The difference between Nvidia\'s initiatives and more traditional virtualization is that the company\'s products support relatively few users for the hardware they require. The Grid gaming server supports 24 users per server box and the Visual Computing Appliance (VCA) only supports eight or 16 depending on the model. Most virtualization is all about dynamically allocating resources like CPU cycles and RAM to give as many users as possible the bare minimum amount of power they need. Instead, Nvidia\'s is about providing a fixed number of users with a pretty specific amount of computing power, thus attempting to recreate the experience of using a regular old computer. There are situations where this makes sense. Given the cost of buying and maintaining workstation hardware, Nvidia\'s argument for the VCA seems more or less convincing. But I\'m slightly less optimistic about the prospect for the Grid gaming server, or any cloud gaming service, really\xe2\x80\x94call it leftover skepticism from OnLive\'s meltdown earlier this year . That doesn\'t mean the technology behind cloud gaming servers is bad, or that the problem they want to solve\xe2\x80\x94that not all devices have high-end graphics hardware in them\xe2\x80\x94doesn\'t exist. In fact, after logging some extended playtime with an Nvidia Project Shield console at this year\'s GTC, I\'m convinced cloud gaming has a future. I just think it looks less like OnLive or the Grid gaming server, and more like what the Shield does\xe2\x80\x94streaming all of the games you already own from a gaming PC already connected to your other, less powerful devices. Let\'s walk through the biggest issues with a service like OnLive or something based on Grid, then consider how moving the same technology on to your home network solves them. Game library Most of the problems we\'ll talk about here are going to be technical, but this one\'s all about business. No matter what technology you\'re using, a company like OnLive or one of Nvidia\'s Grid customers is going to have to cut deals with publishers and independent game developers to make those games available on the service. While the way Grid is implemented suggests that developers won\'t have to do any extra work to make games compatible, that won\'t be the case for all implementations. This whole process takes time and money, and in the end you\'re not guaranteed to get all of the games you want in any one service. Streaming from your local Steam library neatly circumvents this limitation. Not only are all the games you own already paid for and available, but future games from most developers and publishers are practically guaranteed to come to Steam. There are, of course, notable exceptions\xe2\x80\x94but they\'re\xc2\xa0 exceptions \xc2\xa0and not the rule. Any new cloud gaming service would need to have a critical mass of customers to be able to provide a big game library, but there\'s no easy way to achieve critical mass of customers without a big game library. Latency and responsiveness No matter how fast your Internet connection is or how near you are to the server room actually rendering your game, Grid just won\'t be 100 percent as smooth as local rendering all of the time. There are too many variables in play\xe2\x80\x94your own home network, your ISP\'s equipment and wiring, the load on your ISP\'s network, your distance from the server, and any number of other issues that could impact your experience negatively. Unlike something like Netflix, which can buffer video to mask these issues, cloud gaming needs to be streaming in real time all the time. Now, move the computer doing the rendering from someone else\'s server room into your own home. The only limiting factor is going to be your own home network. The most unpredictable elements have been removed, and you\'ll have a much faster connection between your PC and your tablet than you\'d be able to get through most Internet service providers. Rendering performance Each one of Nvidia\'s Grid servers can support up to two dozen users at a time, and each one of those users can only have so much GPU horsepower assigned to them at once. Measured in FLOPS, the amount is roughly equivalent to one of the company\'s mid-range GeForce GT 640 cards. Especially as games get better-looking and this technology moves beyond the 1366\xc3\x97768 display of the Shield console (and it seems reasonable that it will), you\'re going to need more graphics horsepower to make these games look as good as they can. Granted, turning all of the settings in a given game all the way up is more of a "nice to have" than a "need to have." But there are plenty of gamers who game on a PC precisely because they want to crank the settings up beyond what a laptop or game console is capable of. Cost Enlarge / Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang next to a rack of Grid servers. Kyle Orland The main problem with the Grid gaming server from the perspective of a potential service provider is that it just doesn\'t seem like it would scale particularly well. It might be difficult to turn a profit between the initial hardware investment (which is made all the larger by the relatively low number of simultaneous connections each box supports), the need to cut and maintain software licensing deals with publishers, and the space and power required to keep all of the servers up and running. Keeping streaming local passes that cost on to gamers, of course, but if your Grid-powered gaming service can\'t turn a profit and had to shut down, they\'re going to be left out in the cold anyway. Not a perfect solution, but a more realistic one Despite all the potential upside, there are still drawbacks to streaming stuff locally as opposed to through a server like Grid. The first is that you have to own and maintain your own gaming PC. This probably isn\'t too onerous a task for the people interested in this sort of thing, but you\'ll have to pay for the cost of the hardware, the games, and the power usage rather than offloading it to some third party. The second issue is that it becomes more difficult to leave the home with your PC game library. Even if you run your own VPN server at home (or if you otherwise modify your network connection to allow access to your game "server" from outside of your network), you\'re likely to encounter some of the same connectivity and bandwidth issues you\'d get with a Grid server. What we need now is a chance to spend a few days streaming games from our PC to the Shield or a Shield-like tablet. The streaming functionality seemed to work well enough in Nvidia\'s demo, but real-world testing is always warranted. If it works as intended, you can keep your cloud gaming service to yourself\xe2\x80\x94my "private cloud" will be more than good enough.

Forums Subscribe Now Log In Search Technology Lab / Information Technology Nvidia plans to turn Ultrabooks into workstations with Grid VCA server Nvidia continues to push GPUs in the direction of the cloud. by Andrew Cunningham - Mar 22, 2013 3:10 pm UTC 12 Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang directs a demo of the Grid Visual Computing Appliance (VCA) during his GTC 2013 keynote. Andrew Cunningham SAN JOSE, CA\xe2\x80\x94One of the announcements embedded in Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang\'s opening keynote for the company\'s GPU Technology Conference Tuesday was a brand new server product, something that Nvidia is calling the Grid Visual Computing Appliance, or VCA. The VCA is a buttoned-down, business-focused cousin to the Nvidia Grid cloud gaming server that the company unveiled at CES in January. It\'s a 4U rack-mountable box that uses Intel Xeon CPUs and Nvidia\'s Grid graphics cards ( n\xc3\xa9e VGX ), and like the Grid gaming server, it takes the GPU in your computer and puts it into a server room. The VCA serves up 64-bit Windows VMs to users, but unlike most traditional VMs, you\'ve theoretically got the same amount of graphical processing power at your disposal as you would in a high-end workstation. However, while the two share a lot of underlying technology, both Grid servers have very different use cases and audiences. We met with Nvidia to learn more about just who this server is for and what it\'s like to use and administer one. What\xe2\x80\x99s in it? The VCA comes in two different versions: one with a single eight-core, 16-thread Intel Xeon E5-2670 CPU, 192GB of RAM, and eight GPUs across four cards that can support up to eight simultaneous users, and one that doubles all of those specifications and can support 16 simultaneous users. Both systems are the same physical size, however, and the low-end version can be upgraded to support more users if necessary. The number of users the servers can handle at once comes down to the number of GPUs available\xe2\x80\x94the VCA uses the company\'s Grid K2 graphics cards, which essentially place two Quadro K5000-esque GPUs (each with 4GB of GDDR5 graphics memory) on the same card. As you may recall from our original write-up , each of these cards\' GPUs can only handle a single user at a time, which is good for people who need maximum performance but not optimal for those with more (but less-demanding) users. Each user is also given access to 32GB of memory upon connecting to the server. The CPU is the only resource that concurrent users really have to share with each other, which could be a bottleneck depending on your users\' workload\xe2\x80\x94there are simply fewer CPU resources available than there would be if each user had his or her own dual- or quad-core workstation. The entire server should consume just over 2000W of power under full load, though that number may change. Who\xe2\x80\x99s it for? Enlarge / Among other things, the VCA allows users to run high-end Windows workstation applications on Macs and computers with limited processing power. Andrew Cunningham Nvidia is definitely emphasizing the "appliance" part of the VCA\xe2\x80\x94it\'s a standalone box that the company intends for use in small shops without dedicated IT departments. For companies that need to support more users or need something that integrates more fully into an enterprise IT environment, Nvidia will happily point you to one of its partners, companies like VMWare, Citrix, and Microsoft, which offer Grid-equipped products that work with traditional virtualization products (Nvidia is attempting to walk the fine line between offering its own server products and stepping on the toes of the hardware partners it relies on). The VCA is meant to be pretty easy to set up and manage. It all starts with a "template" virtual machine, offered up every time a user connects to the VCA using the client software. By turning the server to management mode, a user can log in using the client software, install new or upgraded software and software patches, and then save a new template. "It\'s the same thing as maintaining one workstation," Nvidia Product Manager Ankit Patel told Ars. "They\'re literally maintaining 16 systems by maintaining one." Because of the way the server works\xe2\x80\x94providing a fresh VM every time a user connects\xe2\x80\x94and because the VCA doesn\'t offer much in the way of local storage, you will need to save your files to some sort of network-attached storage instead. Patel told us that the server would be able to preserve specific settings for applications, though, for users with heavily customized workflows. Since the VCA is offering up virtualized Windows, one potential use case is in shops that primarily rely on OS X or Linux for day-to-day tasks but need to switch into Windows to run specific Windows-only applications (clients are available for Windows, OS X, and Linux at this point). Most of the demos Nvidia showed both during Jen-Hsun Huang\'s keynote and on the exhibition floor were on Macs. Obviously, this also allows systems that have no business running workstation applications\xe2\x80\x94Ultrabooks, cheap desktops, and other such systems\xe2\x80\x94to run these applications pretty well. At least in Nvidia\'s controlled testing environment, performance seemed very good\xe2\x80\x94you\'d be hard-pressed to tell the difference between the software running on the VCA server and software that was running locally. Patel told us that about 10Mbps of bandwidth would provide a good experience at 1920\xc3\x971200 (and that this was the default upper-limit, though administrators can change this value), but that the system could dynamically ramp down the quality of the stream depending on a given user\'s connection. What does it cost? Enlarge / The VCA is costly, but so are desktop workstations. Nvidia Nvidia won\'t be selling the Grid VCA directly to customers, but through its value-added resellers (VARs), who will also be tasked with providing hardware support. The eight-user Grid VCA\'s hardware costs $24,900, plus a $2,400-per-year license to use Nvidia\'s software; the 16-user model costs $39,900 up-front plus $4,800 per year for the software license. Both of the software licenses cover unlimited client devices, useful in cases where employees have multiple work machines or want to use their home computers with the server. The cost of the Windows licenses is rolled into the cost of the server, but you\'ll still need to buy whatever software packages you\'d like to run in your VMs. These prices sound a bit high, though they\'re not absurd in the context of high-end workstations\xe2\x80\x94bear in mind that we just reviewed a $6,300 workstation laptop back in January, and desktop workstations with the Quadro K5000 GPU (to which Nvidia compares the performance of the Grid K2 GPUs) easily run upwards of $3,000 apiece. However, the price of the VCA will be inflated if you also need to purchase client computers to connect to it with. If your workload is more CPU heavy, if your users don\'t mind working in Windows, or if you don\'t need a GPU that\'s as powerful as the K5000, you can easily equip eight users with new workstations for much less than $25,000, though that doesn\'t factor in the cost of managing those systems. In short, the VCA\'s value proposition does make sense, but only if you\'re in its niche: a small organization with no IT outfit that still needs lots of graphics horsepower. What comes next? "I want to keep it simple, I want to get the product in the hands of customers," said Patel, "and I want to get more feedback so I can quickly follow up and give the right features that they want." One focus will be working on the number of users supported by each server; as we mentioned when we originally covered the Grid graphics cards themselves, Nvidia will eventually enable multiple users per GPU for the K2 card so that more people can take advantage of its power at once. Patel also said that Nvidia would like to push in the opposite direction. "It\'s going to be interesting as far as what workload you put on there," he said. "Because in terms of a system I have a CPU-to-GPU ratio\xe2\x80\x94I\'m focused more on GPU-intensive applications, so I\'m actually more interested in going the other way. Not multiple users per GPU, but multiple GPUs per user." Right now, a single user can open multiple workspaces on the same client computer, but those workspaces can\'t pool hardware resources or share data between them. Theoretically, Nvidia could make the entire server\'s hardware available for one user with a software update. Future software updates should also allow administrators to synchronize the template VMs across multiple VCA servers in the event that they have more than one; add support for more client operating systems, depending on their users\' demands; and offer the ability to serve up virtualized Linux in addition to Windows, though Patel told us there were "a lot of obstacles" to overcome before that would be possible. Virtualizing Linux on the VCA could be important to supporting more than eight or 16 users per server, hardware limitations aside, since the VCA would need to come with a Windows license for each user that intended to use the server. "Those costs are going to get weird," said Patel.

Forums Subscribe Now Log In Search Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents Departing commissioner says net neutrality was FCC\xe2\x80\x99s biggest recent failure Robert McDowell, net neutrality foe, shares his FCC parting thoughts with Ars. by Jon Brodkin - Mar 24, 2013 11:00 pm UTC Internet regulation 19 FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell, who is leaving his post. wiredbike Julius Genachowski isn\'t the only member of the Federal Communications Commission who is leaving the FCC . Commissioner Robert McDowell also announced his departure a couple of days ago after serving since 2006. The Republican McDowell and Democrat Genachowski found common ground on numerous issues and praised each other on their way out, but the two were also at loggerheads in some high-profile cases. The biggest in McDowell\'s mind was the net neutrality debate, the commissioner told Ars on Friday. The FCC in 2010 approved net neutrality rules that prevented Internet service providers from blocking lawful traffic and banning discrimination against competitive services running over the ISP\'s networks. Wireless providers were exempt from the rules , angering many consumer advocates. McDowell, though, didn\'t want neutrality rules at all, and he said that net neutrality was the biggest failure under Genachowski. "I just think it was needlessly disruptive and a diversion of FCC resources. But it remains to be seen what the courts think of it," McDowell said. He elaborated: First of all, I\'ve been a strong advocate for a free and open Internet. What I opposed really focused on, first of all, there is no market failure that needed to be addressed. Second, the FCC did not have the statutory authority to do what it did. Third, if there had been a problem there were laws already on the books that would have addressed the problem. There wasn\'t a problem before the rules and there\'s not a problem with any danger of a closed Internet in this country after the rules. For those who think the rules have preserved an open Internet, that\'s sort of like a rooster taking credit for the sunrise. When asked if net neutrality has caused any harm to businesses, McDowell said it\'s not clear yet. There\'s been no obvious harm, he said, because the FCC hasn\'t yet taken any enforcement actions against companies for violating the rules. However, he said capital expenditures in broadband have remained flat even as the economy grew slightly between 2010 and 2011. It\'s too early to tell if that is in any way connected to net neutrality affecting wired service but not wireless. "Spending has always gone up unless there is an economic downturn, and between 2010 and 2011 there was no economic downturn, there was slow economic growth," McDowell said. He argued increases in network efficiency wouldn\'t explain the slow spending, because networks are always getting more efficient. "There\'s a shift to expenditures into the wireless space and one could argue that\'s natural progression, and it probably is," McDowell said. "But did that come at the expense of deploying fiber because fiber is subject to the net neutrality rules while wireless is not? We don\'t know the answer to that, those are questions I\'d like to have answered." The FCC\'s biggest success As for the FCC\'s biggest success under Genachowski, McDowell pointed to the 2011 reform of the Universal Service Fund. He called this "the first federal entitlement reform since the 1996 Welfare Reform Act was passed by the Republican Congress and signed by Bill Clinton." The reform involved changing a fund designed to subsidize rural phone companies. "We eliminated duplicate subsidies for more than one company serving the same area," McDowell said. "And we introduced competitive market incentives such as reverse auctions for the awarding of some of the subsidies. And then most importantly, we repurposed it to support broadband." McDowell acknowledged that Genachowski probably wouldn\'t cite the fund\'s reform as his greatest achievement, yet Genachowski worked across party lines to get it done in a 3-1 vote. "Julius worked hard, relentlessly to find consensus," McDowell said. "He took a risk in trying to make that happen. There were a lot of constituencies that have interests in the universal service program and it was fraught with political peril. He had the courage and the perseverance to make it happen." Many of Genachowski\'s critics from the more liberal side of the aisle criticize him for being too conciliatory to corporate interests, favoring industry over consumers as we noted in our story Friday . But Genachowski gets criticism from multiple angles. TechFreedom, a conservative tech policy think tank, said "With the support of the equally personable Republican Rob McDowell, Genachowski\'s legacy could have been progress on a range of issues where broad consensus exists, like eliminating the regulatory barriers that slow down broadband deployment." In TechFreedom\'s view, that didn\'t happen. The organization blasted the net neutrality decision and said Genachowski should have cleared more spectrum for mobile broadband providers. However, McDowell praised Genachowski for being "a gentleman to work with. He was able to get past our disagreements quickly and move on to the next issue. And that\'s how it should be." And in a statement about McDowell\'s departure, Genachowski returned the compliments. \xe2\x80\x9cRob McDowell has been an extraordinary colleague\xe2\x80\x94deeply knowledgeable about the vital and growing communications and tech sector, creative, wise, and a great partner on the Commission. ... I\xe2\x80\x99m proud that Rob is both a colleague and a friend." The future of the FCC, according to McDowell More than 90 percent of Commission votes have been unanimous, McDowell said. Besides net neutrality, cases where McDowell dissented include the FCC\'s wireless data roaming rules , a decision forcing Comcast to carry the Tennis Channel , and the closing of a " terrestrial loophole " that kept HD content off FiOS. "The vast majority of what we do is unanimous," McDowell said, although he expressed hope that the FCC will place fewer restrictions on mergers in the future. Under Genachowski, the FCC blocked the AT&T/T-Mobile acquisition and placed conditions on others. "I think some of the merger conditions that were forced upon companies had nothing to do with the merger," McDowell said. "I look at it as \'what merger-specific harms are coming about\' and our conditions should be narrowly tailored and perhaps sunsetted to address those harms. For instance, the Comcast/NBCUniversal merger had a lot of conditions in there that were not related at all to the transaction. But others, we just saw T-Mobile/MetroPCS a few days ago, that one had a minimal amount of conditions and was handled well." One thing the next commissioner has to oversee is an auction to repurpose TV broadcast spectrum. That spectrum could be sold to wireless carriers for exclusive use, and some of it could go to unlicensed users to improve technologies like White Spaces. McDowell thinks the FCC will be able to appease both the carriers and White Spaces technology proponents. "I\'ve been a strong proponent of unlicensed use of spectrum, especially the unused TV White Spaces," he said. "But I think the statute really compels us to auction what we harvest from the broadcasters, unless there is some technical reason to not do so. The short answer is that means there will still be plenty of leftover spectrum for White Spaces use. There will still be these gaps for unlicensed use. I think it could be a win-win scenario, I don\'t think its a zero sum game that licensed wins, unlicensed loses, which is how some people are trying to paint it." President Obama will have to nominate replacements for both Genachowski and McDowell. The first quality that the replacements should have, McDowell said, is "a deep and detailed understanding of the issues that the FCC will face, substantive expertise first and foremost." Second, he hopes the replacements will be "patient" with the fast-moving marketplace, and let it run on its own instead of imposing extensive regulations. "None of us can predict the future when it comes to innovation," he said. "The last thing you want is making a rule which freezes in place the status quo, which will likely change rapidly. Sometimes regulators succumb to the temptation of thinking they are smarter than the marketplace or thinking that a nudge from government will produce a better outcome than the market would have delivered on its own without interference." McDowell, the lobbyist? What\'s next for McDowell? It won\'t be lobbying the FCC, at least not right away. "I\xc2\xa0can go work pretty much anywhere but there are rules barring your contact or advocacy with the FCC," he said. "There is a two-year outright ban on advocacy, and other Obama administration restrictions on lobbying." Former Republican FCC Chairman Michael Powell is now CEO of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association. Given McDowell\'s political views and experience, a similar lobbying job could be in his future, but he said that he has not yet decided what he\'d like to do. "I honestly do not know," he said. "There\'s not a job I\'m gunning for. I\'m starting with a blank sheet of paper."

Forums Subscribe Now Log In Search Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents So long, Julius: FCC chair lauded by industry, blasted by activists Genachowski let corporate interests override public ones, nonprofit groups say. by Jon Brodkin - Mar 22, 2013 6:26 pm UTC Government Internet regulation 32 FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski in November 2010 at the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco. JD Lasica Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski today said he will leave the agency in the coming weeks, four years after being appointed by President Obama. At an all-hands meeting of FCC staff, Genachowski listed all his accomplishments, demonstrating how proud he is of his record: Over the past four years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve focused the FCC on broadband, wired and wireless, working to drive economic growth and improve the lives of all Americans. And thanks to you, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s employees, we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken big steps to build a future where broadband is ubiquitous and bandwidth is abundant, where innovation and investment are flourishing. To connect all Americans to high-speed Internet, we adopted a landmark overhaul of multi-billion dollar universal service programs, modernizing them from telephone to broadband and creating the Connect America Fund and the Mobility Fund, an unprecedented investment in broadband infrastructure. To unleash the enormous opportunities of mobile, we pioneered incentive auctions and other cutting-edge spectrum policies.\xc2\xa0To fuel America\xe2\x80\x99s innovation economy, we put in place the first rules to preserve Internet freedom and openness. To drive competition and empower consumers, we opposed and modified transactions where necessary, deployed technology to drive transparency, and took unprecedented enforcement actions. It\'s true that Genachowski occasionally annoyed corporate interests, presiding over the scuttling of AT&T\'s attempted takeover of T-Mobile. Genachowski\'s FCC also\xc2\xa0 blocked LightSquared\'s proposed cellular network, which would have led to interference with GPS devices (despite pressure from LightSquared\'s friends in Congress ). Angry at the FCC for asserting its authority, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives tried to limit the FCC\'s power to make rules and set conditions on mergers. But according to nonprofit public interest groups, Genachowski\'s\xc2\xa0tenure was characterized more by allowing corporate interests to override public ones. Net neutrality loopholes, Americans lacking broadband Genachowski did preside over the enactment of net neutrality rules and a National Broadband Plan to expand Internet access. But he\xc2\xa0allowed wireless operators to evade those net neutrality rules , which prevent Internet service providers from blocking lawful content or discriminating against certain kinds of Internet traffic, such as those from competitors. Three years after the National Broadband Plan was announced, one-third of Americans still lack broadband Internet service, either because it isn\'t available where they live or they can\'t afford it. The group Public Knowledge wrote of Genachowksi: For those of us who represent the public, Chairman Genachowski\xe2\x80\x98s term can best be described as one of missed opportunities. He had the opportunity, but declined, to solidify the agency\xe2\x80\x99s authority and ability to protect consumers with regard to broadband\xe2\x80\x94the communications system of the present and future. As a result, there is a real danger that the FCC will become a powerless and irrelevant agency as the nation\xe2\x80\x99s communications networks change. The Chairman had the opportunity, but declined, to take several important steps that would have promoted more robust competition in the wireline and wireless broadband market. He punted on special access and permitted two major mergers [ Comcast/NBCUniversal and Verizon Wireless/SpectrumCo ], spelling the end of \'facilities-based\' competition between the cable and telephone industries. The Chairman deserves credit for defending both the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s data roaming rules and unlicensed spectrum, for permitting DISH Network to provide terrestrial wireless service, and for releasing the staff report that helped to end AT&T\xe2\x80\x99s attempted takeover of T-Mobile. But it remains to be seen whether those positive steps will mitigate the enormous consolidation that has taken place in the broadband marketplace under his watch. Media reform group Free Press similarly praised the FCC\'s opposition to AT&T/T-Mobile as well as its "push for more online transparency from broadcasters," but the group ticked off a list of failures as well. "Instead of acting as the people\'s champion, he\xe2\x80\x99s catered to corporate interests. His tenure has been marked by wavering and caving rather than the strong leadership so needed at this crucial agency," Free Press wrote. "Genachowski claimed broadband was his agency\'s top priority, but he stood by as prices rose and competition dwindled. He claimed to be a staunch defender of the open Internet, but his Net Neutrality policies are full of loopholes and offer no guarantee that the FCC will be able to protect consumers from corporate abuse in the future." Genachowski praised by Obama, telecom companies Genachowski wasn\'t universally slammed, though. President Obama said the chairman had a "clear focus on spurring innovation, helping our businesses compete in a global economy and helping our country attract the industries and jobs of tomorrow. Because of his leadership, we have expanded high-speed Internet access, fueled growth in the mobile sector, and continued to protect the open internet as a platform for entrepreneurship and free speech." The nonprofit Free\xc2\xa0State Foundation, a proponent of free market policies, said it didn\'t always agree with Genachowski, but it praised him for "reforming the broken USF [ Universal Service Fund ] system" and "his efforts to begin processes to get more spectrum available through spectrum auctions." Telecom companies also gave him high marks, even if they didn\'t love every one of his decisions. AT&T Senior VP Jim Cicconi released a statement praising the outgoing chairman, saying: "He oversaw the drafting and publishing of our nation\xe2\x80\x99s first National Broadband Plan and he identified the spectrum crisis that led to provisions in the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 that will not only make much needed broadband spectrum available for auction but also will hopefully result in the construction of a nationwide, interoperable network for public safety. If that weren\xe2\x80\x99t enough, Chairman Genachowski also issued a unanimous order adopting the first comprehensive reform of universal service and intercarrier compensation. Any chairman should be proud of these accomplishments, which are going to leave a lasting imprint on communications policy in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d Verizon praised Genachowski\'s "commitment to encourage expansion and adoption of broadband." Comcast echoed that praise, adding that Genachowski "developed processes across the agency to ensure FCC decisions were data driven and transparent." "The entire cable industry is grateful to Chairman Genachowski for his exceptional leadership," said Michael Powell, CEO of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association. Powell himself is a former FCC Chairman, a Bush appointee who served from 2001 to 2005. Sprint praised Genachowski, but for different reasons. Sprint believes the FCC helped preserve the ability of smaller carriers (like Sprint) to compete against AT&T and Verizon Wireless. "From his decision to block AT&T\xe2\x80\x99s proposed takeover of T-Mobile USA, to his efforts to reform the Universal Service Fund, intercarrier compensation, special access and wireless Lifeline, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski has repeatedly stood up for consumers and competition," Sprint Senior VP Vonya McCann wrote. T-Mobile lauded Genachowski for "using a light regulatory touch when market forces can solve a problem, while at the same time not shying away from intervention when necessary on issues such as roaming, which have brought measurable benefits to consumers." Genachowski, a Democrat leading the FCC\'s 3-2 Democratic majority, nonetheless made friends with Republicans. FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell, a Republican and net neutrality opponent who is also stepping down, said Genachowski "proved that through hard work, persistence and creativity, bipartisanship and compromise in policymaking can occur in Washington, even in these days of sharp divisions and gridlock." Unfinished work on spectrum Genachowski\'s departure has been expected for a while and is in line with most recent chairmen, who served about four years each. No replacement has been announced by President Obama yet. The next commissioner will have plenty of issues to deal with, including an incentive auction to decide the future of airwaves controlled by TV broadcasters. The auction will likely result in spectrum being sold to wireless carriers and other private interests. Some airwaves are also expected to be reserved for unlicensed use, such as white spaces networks designed to increase Internet access, particularly in rural areas. Genachowski also began the process of creating a spectrum sharing system \xc2\xa0between federal users and cellular companies, and he got the ball rolling on\xc2\xa0 adding 195MHz of unlicensed spectrum to the 5GHz Wi-Fi band. On the issue of expanding access to unlicensed spectrum, some observers will miss Genachowski\'s leadership. The Wireless Innovation Alliance, a consortium including public interest groups like Public Knowledge and technology companies like Google and Microsoft, said, "The Chairman rightly recognized the important roles of licensed and unlicensed spectrum in driving our national economy, and that we need more of both. Indeed, unlicensed \'innovation bands\' have already generated hundreds of billions of dollars in economic growth and now carry more traffic than licensed bands."

Sharon McKellar Less than two weeks ago, Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s 5 Point Cafe \xc2\xa0became the first known establishment in the United States (and possibly the world) to publicly ban Google Glass , the highly anticipated augmented reality device set to be released later this year. The \xe2\x80\x9cNo Glass\xe2\x80\x9d logo that the caf\xc3\xa9 published on its website was developed and released (under a Creative Commons license) by a new London-based group called \xe2\x80\x9c Stop the Cyborgs .\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0The group is composed of three young Londoners who decided to make a public case against Google Glass and other similar devices. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\'s just a few geeks wearing it, it\'s a niche tool [and] I don\'t think it\'s a problem,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, 27, who prefers only to be identified by his first name. He communicated with Ars via Skype and an encrypted Hushmail e-mail account. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if suddenly everyone is wearing it and this becomes as prevalent as smartphones\xe2\x80\x94you can see it becomes very intrusive very quickly. It\'s not about the tech, it\'s about the social culture around it. If you think about what Google\'s business model is, it started as a search engine, and then Google Analytics. [Now, Google is] almost characterizing its [territory as being] the rest of the world. It\'s a loss of space that isn\'t online. [Google Glass] destroys having multiple identities, and I find that quite a scary concept.\xe2\x80\x9d Adam admitted he has never actually used or interacted with Google Glass in person, but he said he has extensive experience with augmented reality and currently is a post-doctoral student specializing in "machine learning" at a London university that he declined to name. He added that he and two friends are behind Stop the Cyborgs. Google has yet to release much detailed information about Google Glass, only allowing small trials involving its own employees \xc2\xa0and select journalists and developers . Stop the Cyborgs\' anti-Glass logo. \xe2\x80\x9cMost people [have] no idea what they were looking at\xe2\x80\x9d On the Stop the Cyborgs site, the group raises a significant concern: namely, that there\xe2\x80\x99s no obvious way to know when the device is on or what it\xe2\x80\x99s actually doing (recording or not). Indeed, Adam\xe2\x80\x99s fears may be warranted, based on The Verge\xe2\x80\x99s own experience last month : At one point during my time with Glass, we all went out to navigate to a nearby Starbucks\xe2\x80\x94the camera crew I\xe2\x80\x99d brought with me came along. As soon as we got inside however, the employees at Starbucks asked us to stop filming. Sure, no problem. But I kept the Glass\xe2\x80\x99 video recorder going, all the way through my order and getting my coffee. Yes, you can see a light in the prism when the device is recording, but I got the impression that most people had no idea what they were looking at. The cashier seemed to be on the verge of asking me what I was wearing on my face, but the question never came. He certainly never asked me to stop filming. Plus, it\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to imagine a situation where photos taken by Glass could be checked against Facebook, Google+, or another social network. For now, Google hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said what sort of facial recognition capability Glass will (or could) have. "Google Glass is possibly the most significant technological threat to \'privacy in public\' I\'ve seen," Woodrow Hartzog, an affiliate scholar at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School, told Ars. "In order to protect our privacy, we will need more than just effective laws and countermeasures. We will need to change our societal notions of what \'privacy\' is." For now, at least one privacy-minded senator doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem worried. "In the past, Google has taken a principled position in making facial recognition an opt-in service for its social network, Google+,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) in an e-mail to Ars. \xe2\x80\x9cThis gives me hope that this same kind of thoughtfulness will be applied to its roll-out of Glass. I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to talking to Google more about its deployment of Glass and what it means for privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d Sharon Ron-McKellar took this photo of Ars editor Cyrus Farivar using Google Glass\xc2\xa0at an event in Oakland last month. Sharon Ron-McKellar \xe2\x80\x9cYou\'re never going to see a stranger as a stranger again\xe2\x80\x9d Still, though, we can only speculate about how society will react to such an expensive geek toy that will almost certainly spawn copycat devices that will get cheaper and more expansive over time. \xe2\x80\x9cIn generation two, when you\'ve got better battery life and apps that do better face recognition\xe2\x80\x94maybe we\'re crying wolf a little early to a certain extent\xe2\x80\x94but [what happens when] you get to competing products?\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe idea that you\'ll have recognition of objects and infrared tags so it will always know what you\'re looking at\xe2\x80\x94that kind of thing, it will be gathering information. It\'s more the face recognition stuff that changes society. You\'re never going to see a stranger as a stranger again.\xe2\x80\x9d That\'s a sentiment Hartzog\xc2\xa0echoed. "Google Glass simply lowers the transaction costs of taking photos and videos and learning about your surroundings," the law professor said. "If Glass has a high adoption rate, it will significantly increase the likelihood of information that was assumed to be obscure or ethereal being discovered, recorded, and subject to publication. The law has yet to figure out how to unravel the fact that there are many situations where individuals expect privacy in public. So perhaps the best approach to this, at least initially, is a vocal, context-based opposition." Even more interestingly, Adam admitted that part of why he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid of associating his name with such a campaign is that it might hurt his chances in the industry where he hopes to get a job. "I want to get a job with Google, eventually,\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cI\'m part of that industry, so anything that I say in regard to that site could come back and bite me. I might not be able to afford my principles.\xe2\x80\x9d Expand full story Promoted Comments DanNeely Ars Scholae Palatinae jump to post Quote: I want to get a job with Google, eventually,\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cI\'m part of that industry, so anything that I say in regard to that site could come back and bite me.

The recording laws of your jurisdiction don\'t suddenly change. If it\'s illegal to record others\' private conversations without consent now, it still will be when Glass hits the market. Small, easily concealed recorders have existed for many years already. There are plenty right now that cost a *fraction* of a Glass. No one is running around demanding that small, affordable recording devices be banned because they will destroy human decency. Well, probably someone is, but we have words for that kind of person. Will there be issues, foreseen and otherwise? Probably. But we\'ve been through this a hundred times in the past few decades. It is silly to be afraid of people wearing their smartphone on their ear instead of in their hand. If you don\'t want recording in your establishment, then why haven\'t you had a sign up saying so for a decade already? 489 posts | registered Apr 14, 2010 javierkatana Smack-Fu Master, in training jump to post So in japan due to cultural preferences by law is required that any mobile phone containing a digital camera must emit sound whenever a photograph is taken. Privacy is a valid concern but the law is the tool to enforce and limit what technology can do. If the world isn\xc2\xb4t ready yet for a technology that comes before the right questions are answered then better hurry up, Google glass will sell like hot cakes and for good. Why focus on what it takes from us and not think of what it brings to the table, like an easy to use interface for people with disabilities, or as mandatory tool for hired babysitters etc. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\xe2\x80\x9d Henry Ford. 3 posts | registered Jun 29, 2008 Reader comments 316 Cyrus Farivar / Cyrus is the Senior Business Editor at Ars Technica, and is also a\xc2\xa0radio producer and author.\xc2\xa0His book,\xc2\xa0The Internet of Elsewhere,\xc2\xa0was published in April 2011. @cfarivar \xe2\x86\x90 Older Story Newer Story \xe2\x86\x92 You May Also Like Top Feature Story Feature Story (3 pages) How I became a password cracker Cracking passwords is officially a "script kiddie" activity now. 69 Stay in the know with Follow Ars on Facebook Follow Ars on Twitter Follow Ars on Google Plus Sign Up for the Ars Newsletter Sign up for the Ars Technica Dispatch, which delivers links to the most popular articles, journals, and multimedia features via e-mail to your inbox every week.

Forums Subscribe Now Log In Search Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents US law enforcement biggest recipient of Microsoft customer data Microsoft joins Google and Twitter with new transparency report. by Peter Bright - Mar 22, 2013 12:00 am UTC Activism Government 39 Transparency. ollily Following the lead set by Google and Twitter , Microsoft has published its first transparency report , tabulating the number of requests for customer data made by law enforcement around the world, the number of responses given, and what kind of information was included in those responses. Microsoft responds to requests for data in 46 countries, those where it says it can properly verify the legitimacy of the requests. In 2012, a total of 70,665 requests were made. The country making the most demands for data was Turkey, with 11,434. The US was in second place, with 11,073. Each request could concern multiple users, with a total of 122,015 users covered by requests. When it comes to the number of requests that returned customer data, however, the US was the clear leader. Of 1,558 requests that resulted in disclosure of some customer content, such as the subject or body of an e-mail or a photograph on SkyDrive, 1,544 were made in the US. The other 14 were split between Brazil (7), Canada (1), Ireland (5), and New Zealand (1). Requests involving only what Microsoft calls "transactional" data were much more evenly distributed. These requests, that might yield information such as an IP address, a name, or a billing address, were far more numerous, with almost 80 percent of all requests resulting in disclosure of this kind of information. Turkey took the top spot here, with 8,997 disclosures of transactional information, with the US, UK, France, and Germany, all receiving 7,000-odd responses. A minority of requests didn\'t result in any information disclosure. In 16.8 percent of cases, no relevant data for the accounts queried was found. Again, Turkey led here, with 2,433 requests not yielding data, with the US, UK, France, and Germany following. Some requests were also rejected for not meeting legal criteria. Almost all of these\xe2\x80\x94759 out of 866 total\xe2\x80\x94came from the US. Microsoft\'s report breaks out data surrounding Skype separately. Skype has historically had a different reporting and recording system, so Microsoft says it can\'t provide the same breakdown of outcomes, though in future it will change how it collects the data so that it can provide this level of detail. The Skype data also spans a different set of countries. The UK made the most Skype requests, making 1,268 out of a total of 4,713. The US made the second most requests, 1,154. In all, law enforcement asked for information about 15,409 different Skype accounts. None of the requests resulted in disclosure of customer content, but an undisclosed number resulted in disclosure of transactional data. Slightly more detailed information exists for the second half of 2012. In that period, Skype\'s compliance team found no information about 2,847 of the accounts queried. The Skype team also provided "guidance" to law enforcement, such as an explanation about why a request was rejected or information about the process for obtaining data, in 501 cases. Going forward, Microsoft plans to update the report every six months. The company also provided information beyond that contained in the report. Strikingly, Microsoft addressed only 11 requests that concerned enterprise customers using Office 365, Azure, or other cloud services. Of those 11, seven were rejected outright or redirected to the customers\' own legal departments. The remaining four, that resulted in some information disclosure, were either done with the customers\' consent, or after following the terms of the enterprise contracts. Over 2012, Google in comparison had 42,327 requests in total, concerning 68,249 accounts. Of these, 16,407 were made in the US, and about 14,600 resulted in information being disclosed (Google provides no data about whether the information is content or transactional). As such, Google receives more requests about US data than Microsoft, and responds to a higher proportion: 89 percent for Google, 79 percent for Microsoft. Conversely, Microsoft responded to far more requests outside the US. Of 25,920 non-US requests, Google responded to barely half: 13,478, or 52 percent. Microsoft attributes this difference in non-US reporting to its greater presence in countries around the world, which makes it easier for courts and law enforcement agencies to contact Microsoft to request data. The lack of information about Skype may frustrate an on-going effort by privacy advocates and activists to get Microsoft to publicly state what data it can collect from Skype users, what data it does collect from Skype users, what its procedures are when asked for data, and what its relationship is with TOM Online, a Chinese company that operates licenses Skype\'s technology for use in China and that provides a modified Skype client that performs censorship of Skype chats. These concerns were raised in an open letter published in January. Microsoft is yet to respond to the letter. Though today\'s transparency report does provide some of the information requested, it also indicates that Microsoft doesn\'t have all the data that the open letter\'s signatories would like. Future records should be more complete, however. Expand full story Reader comments 39 Peter Bright / Peter is a Microsoft Contributor at Ars.

Social: On Off a Share on FB Timeline: Episodes I\'m Watching Series I\'ve Followed Episodes I\'ve Loved Blip\'s mission and principles Blip\'s mission is to help people to discover the best in original web series and to help web series producers make a sustainable living. In pursuing our mission we adhere to a set of rigorous standards. Piracy Even with the Internet\'s ubiquitous distribution, close-to-unlimited inventory and easy duplication of media, Blip believes that rules of property still apply. Unauthorized distribution of someone else\'s content is theft. High-tech theft is just as wrong, both legally and morally, as low-tech theft. We police our site just like retailers police their stores, and we don\'t tolerate theft. Our producers work hard giving voice to their creativity in video, and we won\'t let anyone rob them of their effort. We also won\'t tolerate robbers showing their merchandise on our site. We are fans of "copyleft" licenses such as those offered by Creative Commons . We encourage everyone to look into Creative Commons licenses and adopt them. Every video released under a copyleft license enriches the (lowercase) creative commons in a significant way. Pornography We will not traffic in pornography. Blip is a place for series about ideas and entertainment. We want everyone to feel comfortable coming to our site and having their children and grandparents check it out as well. We\'re proud to be a venue for series that is well-lit, bright, organized and clean, and we are dedicated to keeping Blip exactly this way. Community We believe that producers and viewers are stakeholders in Blip as much as our employees, founders and shareholders. Blip was designed, and continues to evolve, with the goal of serving each of these communities. We make every effort to develop tools, technologies and environments that these communities can take pride in and find useful. We are dedicated to maintaining an excellent relationship with producer and viewer communities and their individual members, whether or not they are Blip users. We make every effort to participate in community forums and to be helpful in every way possible to members of the community. The original Blip was designed based on direct interaction with the videoblogging community. We continue to be grateful to this community and to seek advice from its members, even as the community has evolved and grown over the years. We still get great advice from producers and viewers at BBQs across the country and get-togethers around the world, and we\'re always open to making changes based on community feedback. At Blip, we see software development as a collaborative effort between our company and the communities it serves. Democratization We live in an age characterized by the democratization of expression. We love that professional and up-and-coming independent producers can create entertaining series and gain audiences of millions. We celebrate that they can produce original series as their full time job and make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, or more. Their only constraint is the limit of human creativity. We believe that this liberation of the means of production is one of the most important things to happen in recent history. It allows anyone to create the next great sitcom or to share the reality of daily life across cultural boundaries. This is a beautiful thing, and we are dedicated to furthering this democratization in a way that respects intellectual property rights and in a venue where everyone feels comfortable. Openness We live in an economy of plenty. We believe it is in the interests of the community and in the interests of Blip to be open with media and with data about media. At Blip we are not building a walled garden but instead are actively working to break down walls to enable the free and open sharing of media and metadata throughout the Web.

Skip to content Home In the News Product Featured About Scribd Join Us! \xe2\x86\x90 Older posts Meet the Author: Hugh Howey to Visit\xc2\xa0Scribd Posted on March 15, 2013 by scribdsf | 3 Comments Scribd is very excited to announce that Hugh Howey, author of the New York Times bestselling thriller, Wool will be stopping by Scribd Headquarters in San Francisco this next Tuesday, March 19. Howey will be here from 3-4 p.m. to do a moderated Q&A, reading and book signing. Wool is a post-apocalyptic thriller that has been receiving a ton of positive reviews this week. Howey is currently embarking on an 12-city national book tour, so it is quite exciting that he is able to stop into our corner of the publishing world. Aside from the praise the book has received, it has garnered significant attention for Mr. Howey\xe2\x80\x99s back-story this week in the Wall Street Journal , Huffington Post . He got a unique start in publishing, writing third-shift while working 30-hours a week at a college bookstore. He initially sold his book for less than a dollar on Amazon and most recently, spurned seven-figure offers from all the major publishing houses in favor of Simon & Schuster as long as he could retain the digital rights to his work. As if that were not enough, Ridley Scott bought the film rights and with recent success of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hunger Games\xe2\x80\x9d, it would not be surprising to see Wool serialized and built as both a book and film franchise. If you have time during your busy day at 3 p.m., please come by and take part in this wonderful opportunity to connect and meet with a high-profile author. To register, use the Eventbrite link below and share and spread the word.

Recently, Hugh Howey, author of post-apocalyptic thriller, Wool has reached a level of heightened success related to an unprecedented and innovative publishing deal. Today, Wool is being pushed to the masses and released at both brick-and-mortar bookstores around the country and online. But prior to today, Howey had already hit the jackpot with his successful franchise without the book being released. Publisher Simon & Schuster agreed to the print publication rights while Howey negotiated the e-book rights himself. This is a novel idea in the world of digital publishing and has started to help the evolution of how authors and publishers deal with the digital space. Before the sun even rose this morning, Howey\xe2\x80\x99s Wool had been labeled a success with over half a million copies sold, generating close to 6,000 reviews on Amazon. That is some serious noise. After being courted by multiple publishers, Howey realized that the seven-figure deals were not as important as retaining the digital rights to his work. That may prove to be a gamble, but in the past two years, digital publishing sales has risen steadily. According to a report from the Association of American Publishers, February 2011 results indicated that e-Books enjoyed triple-digit percentage growth, 202.3%, versus February 2010. E-book sales for adult titles in fiction and non-fiction have grown 36% in the first three quarters of 2012. That is some hefty growth, while at the same time, sales for paperback and hardcover sales has been in decline, no doubt aided in the proliferation of digital publishing and the availability of titles on Amazon and Kindle. Aside from the tumultuous state of the digital publishing industry, Howey also had some luck and fate on his side. He initially wrote the first version of the serial Wool in less than three weeks while working 30-hours a week at a university bookstore. He sold the first version on Amazon for less than a dollar and was shocked when 1,000 copies were sold. That was in 2011. At that point, he would have no idea that the serial versions of books like The Hunger Games would have such commercial success in both publishing and Hollywood. Now, as publishers work to ensure Wool enjoys fame in the publishing world, he has already negotiated the film rights to producer Ridley Scott. Today, you can read an excerpt of Wool on Scribd, and at the same time, Howey is receiving plenty of attention in blogs, newspapers and other online press about the highly unusual deal. According to an article in today\xe2\x80\x99s Wall Street Journal : \xe2\x80\x9cI had made seven figures on my own, so it was easy to walk away,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Howey, 37, a college dropout who worked as a yacht captain, a roofer and a bookseller before he started self-publishing. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought, \xe2\x80\x98How are you guys going to sell six times what I\xe2\x80\x99m selling now?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9c It\xe2\x80\x99s a sign of how far the balance of power has shifted toward authors in the new digital publishing landscape. Self-published titles made up 25% of the top-selling books on Amazon last year. Four independent authors have sold more than a million Kindle copies of their books, and 23 have sold more than 250,000, according to Amazon. Publishing houses that once ignored independent authors are now furiously courting them. In the past year, more than 60 independent authors have landed contracts with traditional publishers. Several won seven-figure advances. A handful have negotiated deals that allow them to continue selling e-books on their own, including romance writers Bella Andre and Colleen Hoover, who have each sold more than a million copies of their books. Howey himself further delves into the story of his unprecedented success in a dispatch on Huffington Post that reveals the intriguing nature and development of discussions that led to his unique deal with Simon & Schuster: The problem was that publishers were willing to pay a lot of money to take all of my rights forever, but nobody wanted to do a print-only deal. Even major publishers (especially major publishers) could see in their balance sheets where the industry was heading. But there will always be a place for bookstores and great print editions, and I wanted to form that partnership without giving up a known living wage for an unknown jackpot. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have that ability to gamble (I never have). It made it easy to say no, even though it was life-altering amounts of money being offered. The stability of a monthly income was more important, as was knowing that I would be miserable to sign my life away like that. I floated one final option, which gained zero traction. This was the idea of licensing the rights to the book for a finite period of time. This is how my foreign deals are structured. It seemed to me that this would eventually be the future of US publishing. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to be. A second round of interesting talks came and went. As this week unfolds, it is a sure bet that publishing industry will be keeping their eyes on the sales at bookstores. Simon & Schuster released hardcover and paperback versions of the book simultaneously today, which essentially are competing with Howey\xe2\x80\x99s digital publications. While the experiment unfolds, feel free to check out the digital excerpt below and available on Scribd\xe2\x80\x99s homepage.

Widowed for the second time aged thirty-one, Katherine Parr finds she has fallen deeply for the dashing courtier Thomas Seymour and hopes at last to marry for love. However, obliged to return to court, she attracts the attentions of another: the ailing, egotistical and dangerously powerful monarch Henry VIII, who dispatches his love rival, Seymour, to the continent. No one is in a position to refuse a royal proposal so, haunted by the fates of his previous wives\xe2\x80\x94two executions; two enforced annulments; one death in childbirth\xe2\x80\x94Katherine is obliged to wed Henry Tudor and become his sixth queen. Committed to religious reform, Katherine must draw upon all her instincts to navigate the treachery of the court, drawing a tight circle of women around her including her stepdaughter Meg, traumatized by events from their past that are shrouded in secrecy, and their loyal servant Dot, who knows and sees more than she understands. But with the Catholic faction on the rise once more, reformers being burned for heresy, and those close to the king vying for position in the new regime, Katherine\xe2\x80\x99s survival seems unlikely. Yet as she treads the razor\xe2\x80\x99s edge of court intrigue, she never quite gives up on love. A must-read for fans of Philippa Gregory, Hilary Mantel, and Alison Weir, Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Gambit brings to life the remarkable story of Katherine Parr as she battles with those intent on destroying her, but also with her own heart.

That is the question tackled by Chicago Public Radio\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Curious City,\xe2\x80\x99 a radio program that looks at city issues and relevant and current intriguing features about the Chicagoland region. This week, their team came up with a water taste test . More an experiment designed to get at the heart of a subject many people may not have quite a handle on. Primarily, you have the entire methodology of which the water is filtered, treated and deliver to homes and business. Additionally, and further complicating the issues of water consumption are the layers of municipal governments which all receive water in different ways. One village may get their water from Lake Michigan, while others buy their water from the City of Chicago and still others tap their water reserves from local rivers. Curious City published this document that shows how you can perform a taste test using various methods and samples. View this document on Scribd Watch the Curious City team in action and see how the water taste tests unfold: We often overlook the subject of water, it is freely available to most of our homes. Scribd has a variety of resources that address the issues of water availability or scarcity and environmental issues. United Nations has this article published about auditing water supplies for small towns . Small water utilities face unique challenges in delivering water and sanitation services to their customers. With a limited revenue base and few opportunities to benefit from economies of scale, they often suffer from severe skill shortages and a long legacy of underinvestment in infrastructure and capacity enhancement. To overcome these challenges, the small utilities need to maximize their operating efficiencies and ensure optimum utilization of their assets.

Bob Lee Swagger returns with a fascinating look at an alternate narrative that probes the lingering mystery of John F. Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s assassination. Currently, the excerpt is available to Scribd readers where it\xe2\x80\x99s currently featured on our homepage and can be accessed here . Stephen Hunter discusses the roots of Bob Swagger novel dating back to its inception as well as how he worked with some of the intricacies of the plot details. You can read the entirety of this interview here. Q: The Third Bullet has some roots in the very first Bob Lee Swagger novel you wrote twenty years ago called Point of Impact. Tell us a little about the relationship between the two books. A: Point of Impact was a very tough book to write\xe2\x80\x94one problem was that it was inspired by and set to be about the JFK assassination. When I started it everyone believed in conspiracy. Halfway through I read Case Closed by Gerald Posner and I immediately ceased believing in conspiracy. Thus I was halfway through a novel whose whole intellectual premise had just been destroyed. So I patched and changed, and abridged and diddled, and in the end separated Point of Impact from the JFK assassination. But I am sloppy and I missed stuff, lots of stuff. Twenty years passed, new ideas came to me about this and that, and suddenly I saw an opportunity to do the JFK book of my dreams. I had a researcher go back and document all the connections to JFK that remained in Point of Impact, and I used those as a foundation for The Third Bullet. Q: How did you connect the two plots? A: The main problem I had with Point of Impact was the villain; he was too broad, encompassing both Special Forces experience and Washington intelligence culture smarts. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get it to work. (I had obviously never heard of Richard Armitage!) Late in the process, I broke that character into two: Col. Raymond Shreck, a court-martialed Green Beret who\xe2\x80\x99d become a freelance mayhem expert, and Hugh Meachum, an elderly (to me; I was in my 40s at the time) Ivy League old boy and Intelligence sprite of mysterious connections. It saved the book and it made The Third Bullet possible, because I was able to resurrect Hugh Meachum for a large role. I had great fun with Hugh and believe me, there\xe2\x80\x99d be no book at all without Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s voice and my wife Jean\xe2\x80\x99s coffee. Q: Point of Impact was made into the movie Shooter, starring Mark Wahlberg as a young Bob Lee Swagger. Speaking as a Pulitzer Prize-winning film critic, who would you cast to play Swagger now, in The Third Bullet? A: Mark was wonderful and delivered a superb performance\xe2\x80\x94there was no movie without Mark. But for this book, we need someone older and wiser. I\xe2\x80\x99d ideally cast Tommy Lee Jones whose face has collapsed into an Egyptian cataract of woe and melancholy. He\xe2\x80\x99s the right age and in my humble opinion still vital and virile (he happens to be my age!) We will leave you with some links to video interviews with Hunter as well as his take on the weapons that were used in the JFK assignation .
