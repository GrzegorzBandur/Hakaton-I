S'FlowingData | Data Visualization, Infographics, and Statistics Log in \xc2\xa0or\xc2\xa0 Become a Member Membership Tutorials Books Twitter Odds of a perfect NCAA March Madness bracket March 22, 2013 to Statistics by Nathan Yau Math professor Jeff Bergen explains the odds of picking a perfect bracket . The first probability is based on a 50/50 split of correct picks, which is like using fair coin flips to pick winners. Bergen doesn\'t really go into how he calculated the second probability, but that smaller number comes up by bumping up the probability of picking the right team for each game. I think he\'s using an average probability of slightly less than 70% (based on simulation results from this old Wall Street Journal column ). That\'s why businesses can offer up million dollar prizes. In all likelihood, no one is going to win, which turns out to be a great business model for insurance companies who back these contests : If millions of people enter a particular contest, it might seem like the chance of someone winning is suddenly in the realm of possibility. But there\'s a catch: This scenario assumes everyone maximized their chances by picking mostly favorites, so those with the best shot at winning are likely to have identical entries. These contests generally protect themselves from big losses by stating they\'ll divvy up the loot if there are multiple perfect brackets. These favorable conditions make insuring these prize offers a good business, as the Dallas company SCA Promotions has discovered. SCA, founded by 11-time world bridge champion Robert D. Hamman, has taken on the insurance risk for roughly 50 perfect-bracket prizes -- including a Sporting News offer of $1 million in 2001, according to vice president Chris Hamman, the founder\'s son. In the 12 years it has been doing so, SCA has never had to pay out a claim. A visualization of pi for high school math students March 22, 2013 to Data Art by Nathan Yau On Kickstarter: A project that uses a visualization of pi to connect Brooklyn high school students to their community . They\'ve already made a histogram of emotions in their school\'s hallway and a stacked area chart mural at a nearby senior center. Next up is a wall currently covered in graffiti. In Math class, students will construct the golden spiral based on the Fibonacci Sequence and begin to explore the relationship between the golden ratio and Pi. The number Pi will be represented in a color-coded graph within the golden spiral. In this, the numbers will be seen as color blocks that vary in size proportionately within the shrinking space of the spiral, allowing us to visualize the shape of Pi and it\'s negative space. Backed. Internet Census March 22, 2013 to Statistical Visualization by Nathan Yau Upon discovering hundreds of thousands open embedded devices on the Internet, an anonymous researcher conducted a Census of the Internet, mapping 460 million IP addresses around the world . While playing around with the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) we discovered an amazing number of open embedded devices on the Internet. Many of them are based on Linux and allow login to standard BusyBox with empty or default credentials. We used these devices to build a distributed port scanner to scan all IPv4 addresses. These scans include service probes for the most common ports, ICMP ping, reverse DNS and SYN scans. We analyzed some of the data to get an estimation of the IP address usage. It\'s a pretty thorough analysis, but the conclusion interested me most: The why is also simple: I did not want to ask myself for the rest of my life how much fun it could have been or if the infrastructure I imagined in my head would have worked as expected. I saw the chance to really work on an Internet scale, command hundred thousands of devices with a click of my mouse, portscan and map the whole Internet in a way nobody had done before, basically have fun with computers and the Internet in a way very few people ever will. I decided it would be worth my time. It makes me feel...uneasy. [Thanks, Roger] Declining songwriter ratings with age March 21, 2013 to Statistics by Nathan Yau Do singer-songwriters age well like a fine wine, or does quality decline with age? Kyle Biehle analyzed fan ratings by age . I understand all of the reasons for not comparing artists in this way. Despite twenty-one Academy Award nominations, Woody Allen never attends the Oscars. His reason is that art isn\'t competition \xe2\x80\x94 judging art is so subjective who\'s to say who or what is best? After all one man\'s Poison is another man\'s Cream. Similarly, Elvis Costello (featured in the viz) is famously credited with saying: "Writing about music is like dancing about architecture - It\'s a really stupid thing to want to do." I agree that using ratings - whether from fans or critics \xe2\x80\x94 to judge artistic merit is at best flawed and at worst a fool\'s exercise. But I wanted to do it anyway. Most peak in their 20s and either stabilize later on or continue to decline. Occasionally, as in the case with Bob Dylan, there\'s some see-sawing. Take a look at the Tableau interactive for a closer look. [via Waxy ] Interactive: Common chord progressions in 1,300 songs March 21, 2013 to Network Visualization by Nathan Yau If you listen to the radio long enough, you\'ve probably noticed that many songs sound similar or remind of you of a song you\'ve heard before. Hooktheory shows you just how similar some songs are via chord progressions in over 1,300 songs . The small group analyzed the data last year and presented some static charts, but this interactive version takes it a step further. Simply start by selecting a chord in the network diagram. Songs that use that chord appear on the right. Then select another chord in the network diagram to find songs that use the chord progression from the original to the new. Keep selecting chords to filter further. So in the end, there are two main things you can do: (1) Find songs that use the same chord progression and (2) see the most likely chord given the current selection. My musical knowledge from middle school jazz band is long gone, but it\'s fun to explore, and you\'ll likely find relationships to songs that you didn\'t expect. [Thanks, Dave] A new brand of cartographer March 20, 2013 to Mapping by Nathan Yau Emily Underwood on new cartographers and the growing field : Geographers have traditionally studied how the natural environment contributes to human society and vice versa, whereas cartographers have focused more explicitly on the art and science of mapmaking. Over the past couple of decades, a new field has emerged: geographical information systems (GIS), blending the study and expression of geographic information. Cartography and geography have overlapped and spawned innumerable subspecialties and applications. Modern geographers and cartographers are involved in diverse projects: tracking fleets of vehicles or products, helping customers locate a Dunkin\' Donuts, modeling environmental scenarios such as oil spills, and studying the spread of disease. You could substitute visualization and statistics for cartography throughout, and it\'d almost all still be valid. The reoccurring theme is that although academic programs can be fine resources, most of your success has to do with what you can learn on your own, as data-related fields are changing fast. How to be Interesting by Jessica Hagy March 19, 2013 to Infographics by Nathan Yau Jessica Hagy, the one who made Venn diagrams on index cards popular, has a new book out today: How to be Interesting . You want to leave a mark, not a blemish. Be a hero, not a spectator. You want to be interesting. (Who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t?) But sometimes it takes a nudge, a wake-up call, an intervention!\xe2\x80\x94and a little help. This is where Jessica Hagy comes in. A writer and illustrator of great economy, charm, and insight, she\xe2\x80\x99s created How to Be Interesting , a uniquely inspirational how-to that combines fresh and pithy lessons with deceptively simple diagrams and charts. The book started from this , which could probably also stand in as a guide on how to enjoy life. Monitor your surroundings with these sensors March 19, 2013 to Self-surveillance by Nathan Yau It wasn\'t long ago that sensors and personal tracking seemed like pure nerdery . In the early stages of graduate school \xe2\x80\x94 before smartphones were popular or even widely available \xe2\x80\x94 I played around with sensors that had finicky battery life and Internet connectivity, the software was buggy, and the hardware looked clunky. New tracking devices pop up regularly these days. They\'re built and designed for a wider audience, and sometimes to my surprise, the devices are embraced by the target audience. It started with personal trackers that are fitness and health-related, but people are branching out now to monitoring their surroundings. Two showed up on my radar this past week: CubeSensors and Thermodo . Continue Reading An exploration of how Oscar winners express gratitude March 18, 2013 to Visualization by Nathan Yau Each year, Oscar speeches seem to follow a similar format, with familiar names and groups sputtered in 30 seconds. For her master\'s project, Thank the Academy, digital media student Rebecca Rolfe explored these patterns . Continue Reading App shows what the Internet looks like March 15, 2013 to Mapping by Nathan Yau In a collaboration between PEER 1 Hosting, Steamclock Software , and Jeff Johnston , the Map of the Internet app provides a picture of what the physical Internet looks like . Continue Reading Other ways to follow FlowingData March 14, 2013 to Announcements by Nathan Yau With Google Reader closing its doors in July (which stinks because I use it multiple times per day), now is a good time to make a switch. For those who want to stick with RSS, you can grab the feed here . Note the change in feed URL. I used to use a service called Feedburner to deliver the RSS, but that\'s owned by Google, too, so it\'s probably best to move away from there. Then of course you can follow @flowingdata on Twitter . Or Facebook . Or Google+ . Or via daily or weekly email . Feltron 2012 Annual Report March 14, 2013 to Self-surveillance by Nathan Yau Today might be pi day, but yesterday was Feltron Report day. The theme this year is visual density \xe2\x80\x94 or maybe programmatic graphics. Either way, it looks mighty fine. Choosing the right seat March 13, 2013 to Infographics by Nathan Yau It can be tricky picking the right seat at a dinner party. So much depends on how many people there are and what shape the table is. Luckily, Alex Cornell provides a guide on where to sit and when to arrive to get the best seat of the night . The 4-person circle is your best bet. This is the ideal setup. You are safe sitting in any seat. Regardless how interesting everyone is, you pretty much can\xe2\x80\x99t go wrong. Note: as the diameter of the table increases, so too does the importance that you sit adjacent to someone you like. Sorry for always sitting at the lonely end seat in the 7-person rectangle. [via kottke ] Word tree for any URL or Twitter username March 12, 2013 to Network Visualization by Nathan Yau In 2007, Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Vi\xc3\xa9gas created the word tree , a search tool for unstructured text. You enter the text, pick a word or phrase, and you can see how other words and phrases branch from the root. Data visualization developer Jason Davies rephrased the visualization in JavaScript, and you can enter a URL or a Twitter username (or enter your own text like with the original). There\'s also a nice sidebar that makes it easier to browse through the text. So for example, the above is a word tree for The Cat in the Hat , and you can see what branches from Thing One and Thing Two. The phrase "and Thing Two" often follows "Thing One" as do exclamation points. The reverse feature comes in handy for text like Steve Jobs\' commencement speech . Data hackathon challenges and why questions are important March 12, 2013 to Statistics by Nathan Yau Jake Porway, executive director of DataKind on data hackathons and why they require careful planning to actually work : Any data scientist worth their salary will tell you that you should start with a question, NOT the data. Unfortunately, data hackathons often lack clear problem definitions. Most companies think that if you can just get hackers, pizza, and data together in a room, magic will happen. This is the same as if Habitat for Humanity gathered its volunteers around a pile of wood and said, "Have at it!" By the end of the day you\'d be left with a half of a sunroom with 14 outlets in it. Without subject matter experts available to articulate problems in advance, you get results like those from the Reinvent Green Hackathon. Reinvent Green was a city initiative in NYC aimed at having technologists improve sustainability in New York. Winners of this hackathon included an app to help cyclists "bikepool" together and a farmer\'s market inventory app. These apps are great on their own, but they don\'t solve the city\'s sustainability problems. They solve the participants\' problems because as a young affluent hacker, my problem isn\'t improving the city\'s recycling programs, it\'s finding kale on Saturdays. Without clear direction on what to do with the data or questions worth answering, hackathons can end up being a bust from all angles. From the organizer side, you end up with a hodgepodge of projects that vary a lot in quality and purpose. From the participant side, you\'re left up to your own devices and have to approach the data blind, without a clear starting point. From the judging side, you almost always end up having to pick a winner when there isn\'t a clear one, because the criteria of the contest was fuzzy to begin with. This also applies to hiring freelancers for visualization work. You should have a clear goal or story to tell with your data. If you expect the hire to analyze your data and produce a graphic, you better get someone with a statistics background. Otherwise, you end up with a design-heavy piece with little substance. Basically, the more specific you can be about what you\'re looking for, the better. Amiigo: The exercise tracker that identifies exercises March 11, 2013 to Self-surveillance by Nathan Yau Self-tracking devices are all the rage these days. I went to the Apple store, and there was practically a whole wall of them. They were all uni-taskers though. There was one for cycling, another for running, and one for golfing. Amiigo, an Indiegogo campaign with four days left to contribute (but funded to completion five times over as of this writing), aims to track multiple exercises and figure out what you\'re exercise you\'re doing automatically . Continue Reading What data brokers know about you March 11, 2013 to Statistics by Nathan Yau Lois Beckett for ProPublica has a thorough piece on data brokers \xe2\x80\x94 companies that collect and sell information about you \xe2\x80\x94 and what they know and where they get the data from. They start with the basics, like names, addresses and contact information, and add on demographics, like age, race, occupation and "education level," according to consumer data firm Acxiom\'s overview of its various categories. But that\'s just the beginning: The companies collect lists of people experiencing "life-event triggers" like getting married, buying a home, sending a kid to college \xe2\x80\x94 or even getting divorced. Credit reporting giant Experian has a separate marketing services division, which sells lists of "names of expectant parents and families with newborns" that are "updated weekly." The companies also collect data about your hobbies and many of the purchases you make. Want to buy a list of people who read romance novels? Epsilon can sell you that, as well as a list of people who donate to international aid charities. So if you\'re wondering why you received that catalog in the mail, it was probably because a store sold your purchase data to a broker.

The world as one city March 8, 2013 to Data Art by Nathan Yau When we build models of the world, we often think of it broken down into pieces, such as cities, counties, and countries. In their newly funded project The City of 7 Billion , architects Joyce Hsiang and Bimal Mendis aim to model the world as one city , to study the impact of population growth on the environment and natural resources on a larger scale. Every corner of the planet, they argue, is "urban" in some sense, touched by farming that feeds cities, pollution that comes out of them, industrialization that has made urban centers what they are today. So why not think of the world as a single urban entity? Hsiang and Mendis don\'t yet know exactly what this will look like (that is the question, Mendis says). But they are planning to seed their geo-spatial model with worldwide data on population growth, economic and social indicators, topography, ecology and more. Ultimately, they hope, other researchers will be able to use the open-source platform for research on development patterns or air quality; the public will be able to use it to grasp the implications of building in a flood plain or implementing an energy policy; and architects will be able to use it to view the world as if it were a single project site. Along with a slew of other challenges I am sure, one of the big ones is finding comparable data at high granularity. Large cities tend to track (and hopefully release) data about what\'s going, but once you step out of the major areas, data grows scarce. They started with population , which was transformed into the physical installation above. Using search data to find drug side effects March 8, 2013 to Statistics by Nathan Yau Along the same lines as Google Flu Trends, researchers at Microsoft, Stanford and Columbia University are investigating whether search data can be used to find interactions between drugs . They recently found an interaction. Using automated software tools to examine queries by six million Internet users taken from Web search logs in 2010, the researchers looked for searches relating to an antidepressant, paroxetine, and a cholesterol lowering drug, pravastatin. They were able to find evidence that the combination of the two drugs caused high blood sugar. The idea is that people are searching for symptoms and medications, and this data is stored in anonymized search logs. They then followed a suspicion that using the two drugs at the same time might cause hyperglycemia. Those that searched for the two drugs were more likely to search for hyperglycemia than the control group (probably those who didn\'t search for hyperglycemia). The work is still in its infancy, but it\'ll be interesting to see how this sort of data can be used to supplement existing work by the Food and Drug Administration.

S'Asia travel guide - Wikitravel Help Wikitravel grow by contributing to an article! Learn how . Asia From Wikitravel Jump to: navigation , search Contents Regions Cities Other destinations Understand Get in Get around Talk [+] See Itineraries Do Buy Eat Drink Sleep [+] Stay safe Crime Stay healthy Contact Asia is too massive and diverse to conceptualize as a single digestible travel "destination". Even defining the borders of this continent is difficult - from the mountains around the Black Sea in the west, to the snow fields of Siberia in the east, there are more people and cities in Asia than outside of it. Band-e Haibat Lake in Afghanistan Asia\'s and the world\'s highest point is Mount Everest, along the border of Tibet (China) and Nepal, which rises to 8,848\xc2\xa0m (29,028\xc2\xa0feet) above sea level. Its lowest point is the Dead Sea , located at the meeting points of Israel, the Palestinian Territories, and Jordan, whose surface is 400\xc2\xa0m (1,312\xc2\xa0feet) below sea level. Asia\'s longest river is the Yangtze, which runs 6,300\xc2\xa0km (3,915\xc2\xa0miles) through China, from all the way from the high Tibetan Plateau to Shanghai. Its largest lake is the 386,400\xc2\xa0sq\xc2\xa0km (149,200\xc2\xa0square\xc2\xa0mile) Caspian Sea, which is surrounded by several Central Asian nations. Asia is bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the east, by Australia to the south east, and by the Indian Ocean to the south. It is bordered by the Red Sea to the south west, by Europe and Urals to the west, and by the Arctic Ocean to the north. Travel options range widely, from the desert ruins and modern mega-malls of the Middle East to the magnificent ancient monuments in South Asia , and from the beach bungalows and jungle treks of South-East Asia to the mega-cities and technology capitals of East Asia . Find out more about regions, destinations, and itineraries below. Asia offers very diverse travel options. There are ultra modern, largely democratic countries like Japan and the East Asian Tigers of Singapore , Hong Kong , Taiwan and South Korea which are very prosperous and in which people enjoy very high standards of living. On the other hand, Afghanistan , Laos and East Timor are extremely poor countries where people struggle even to get a few grains of rice each day. Of course, there are also many countries lying somewhere in the middle, such as the emerging powerhouses of China and India which make wonderful travel destinations in themselves due to their long history, size and diversity. Thailand is a magnet for travellers, with great food, a tropical climate, fascinating culture and great beaches. Asia also contains North Korea , suffering under one of, if not the most, oppressive regimes in the world and, therefore, very safe for travellers. [ edit ] Regions Map of Asia\'s regions and countries Central Asia ( Afghanistan , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan ) East Asia ( China (including Hong Kong & Macau ), Japan , Mongolia , North Korea , South Korea , Taiwan ) Middle East ( Bahrain , Iran , Iraq , Israel , Jordan , Kuwait , Lebanon , Oman , Palestinian Territories , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Syria , Turkey , United Arab Emirates , Yemen ) Russia and the Caucasus ( Azerbaijan , Armenia , Georgia , Russia ) Russia\'s a huge country of vast, empty expanses comprising much of Asia, while the Caucasus is densely populated, warm and friendly, but with some dangerous parts South Asia ( Bangladesh , Bhutan , India , Maldives , Nepal , Pakistan , Sri Lanka ) Southeast Asia ( Brunei , Cambodia , East Timor , Indonesia , Laos , Malaysia , Myanmar (Burma), Philippines , Singapore , Thailand , Vietnam ) The Taj Mahal in Agra , India Mud Skyscrapers in Shibam , Yemen [ edit ] Cities Bangkok \xe2\x80\x94 Thailand\'s bustling, cosmopolitan capital with temples, nightlife and fervour Beijing \xe2\x80\x94 capital of the People\'s Republic of China with the Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City Dubai \xe2\x80\x94 most modern and progressive emirate in the UAE, developing at an unbelievable pace Hong Kong \xe2\x80\x94 a truly world-class metropolis with a unique mixed Chinese and British heritage Jerusalem \xe2\x80\x94 containing the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Old City, this city is sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims Mumbai \xe2\x80\x94 most eclectic and cosmopolitan city of India, well-known for the Bollywood film industry Seoul \xe2\x80\x94 beautiful palaces, great food and a hopping nightlife, Seoul is a frenetic way to experience the Asia of old and new Singapore \xe2\x80\x94 modern, affluent city-state with a medley of Chinese, Indian, Malay and British influences Tokyo \xe2\x80\x94 the world\'s largest city brings a huge, wealthy and fascinating metropolis with high-tech visions of the future side by side with glimpses of old Japan [ edit ] Other destinations Lanterns in Tokyo , Japan These are just ten of the most notable destinations outside of major cities.

For the Middle East, Dubai is by far the largest hub, with Doha and Abu Dhabi also having reasonably good connections. If you are coming to Asia by train, you\'ll be likely coming in through Russia or Turkey, although other options may exist. For an interesting experience, try the Trans-Siberian Railway . The entrance to the Forbidden City, Beijing [ edit ] Get around Due to the vast distances and expanses of water separating Asia\'s different regions, air travel is likely to be the preferred mode of transport between the regions\' many travel destinations. Fares are lower on average than in Europe or America, and low cost airlines in Asia are rapidly expanding their networks particularly in Southeast Asia. [ edit ] Talk Many languages are spoken throughout Asia, comprising a number of families and some unrelated isolates. While the local languages are always best, some blanket languages can be useful in multiple countries. In the Middle East , Arabic is widely understood, while knowledge of Russian will help you in Central Asia and the Caucasus . Hindi / Urdu is useful in South Asia and Malay / Indonesian will help you in Southeast Asia . Mandarin Chinese is spoken by most in China, and understood in Taiwan, and to a lesser degree, in Singapore.

[ edit ][ add listing ] Drink Usually the largest city or capital has the best clubs. [ edit ][ add listing ] Sleep [ edit ] Stay safe Safety in Asia can vary wildly, but it is a safe place in general. Nearly all tourist attractions on the continent are far from conflict, but there are a few regions in which conflict and/or general lawlessness exists. The most obvious examples are Afghanistan and Iraq . Afghanistan is under foreign occupation, and both countries are in a state of war against insurgent groups such as the Taliban, Al Qaeda, and various other armed forces. These countries are considered no-go areas and should be completely avoided by travellers (if one absolutely must go, consult War zone safety and the authorities of your country before you go). Yemen could also be added to the list of no-go countries, due to a very high threat of terrorist attacks, kidnappings, tribal violence and general lawlessness. Since January 2011, Syria also should not be visited due to civil unrest, including some indiscriminate attacks on or in cities and checkpoints. Other countries in Asia generally can be visited, though some countries have regions and areas that should be avoided. The Middle East is generally known for its political tensions, and while true for some part, most of the region can be visited without any major risks. The Gaza Strip is effectively a war zone between Palestinian factions and the Israeli army, where kidnappings of foreigners have occurred. Israel has coped with missile attacks as well as suicide bombings by Islamic militant groups, such as Hamas and Hezbollah. Lebanon and the West Bank (Palestinian National Authority) generally cope with an unstable political situation and internal conflict. Some regions of the Caucasus are considered dangerous due to active insurgent groups, particularly the North Caucasus ( Chechnya ), Abkhazia and South Ossetia . Bahrain has experienced some political violence, too, so check on current conditions before you go. Iran and Pakistan cope with a low-level conflict in the Balochistan region against Baloch insurgents. More dangerously, Pakistan is active in a full-scale war in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas , both of which should not be visited. Kashmir , claimed by both Pakistan and India, is also a region with tens of thousands of casualties since 1989 due to political strife and insurgency. In 2009, the Naxalite-Maoist insurgency in India has resurfaced, particularly in Chhattisgarh and other parts of Eastern India . Northeastern India also copes with dozens of insurgent groups, some of which have armed factions. Southeast Asia is a major travel region and most of it is perfectly safe to visit. A notable exception is East Timor , which continues to face sporadic internal ethnic and political tension and related violence may occur. But even in some popular countries, there are some areas that should be avoided. The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao in the south of the Philippines is an area of conflict with several Muslim and communist rebel groups fighting with the Philippine army. It was declared the world\'s most hazardous area for journalists in 2009 by the Committee to Protect Journalists. 18 reporters died in a massacre in Maguindanao that claimed the lives of almost 60 people. The rest of the country, specifically Luzon and the Visayas , are safe, just like the rest of Mindanao (including Davao and Cagayan de Oro areas). Thailand , the most visited country in Southeast Asia, is perfectly safe, with the notable exception of four deep southern provinces , where fighting between the Thai military and Islamic insurgent groups still continues to this day. Indonesia is a very diverse country, with armed groups fighting for independence in Papua . Maluku is relatively safe now, but has seen periodic eruptions of violence occur in 1999-2003. Indonesia also copes with Islamic extremist groups throughout the country. Bali , the most popular tourist destination of the country, dealt with Islamic terrorist attacks in Kuta in 2002 and 2005. The island can be visited, but avoiding large gatherings and crowded nightclubs could be advised. East Asia is probably the safest area in the continent, but political tensions also exist in this region. You might want to avoid the border between North Korea and South Korea as these two countries are technically still at war with each other. China , a vast and diverse country, is surprisingly safe for its size, yet the restive provinces of Tibet (and its accompanying counties and prefectures in neighbouring provinces) and Xinjiang are often restricted to foreign travellers at any hint of trouble. [ edit ] Crime Refer to the specific country pages and the authorities of your country for more information. [ edit ] Stay healthy Many areas of Asia, especially Southeast Asia and South Asia, are humid tropical, and there are certain health risks attached to travel in those regions -- such as dengue fever and risk of malaria. Consult the country articles for specific information. [ edit ] Contact This article is an outline and needs more content. It has a template , but there is not enough information present.

Caribbean From Wikitravel Jump to: navigation , search Contents Understand [+] Regions Lucayan Archipelago Greater Antilles [+] Lesser Antilles Leeward Islands Windward Islands ABC Islands Other islands and territories Cities Other destinations [+] Get in By plane [+] Get around By plane By boat Sunset on Montserrat The islands of the Caribbean Sea or West Indies are an extensive archipelago in the far west of the Atlantic Ocean, mostly strung between North and South America . They\'ve long been known as a resort vacation destination for honeymooners and retirees, but a small movement toward eco-tourism and backpacking has started to open up the Caribbean to more independent travel. With year-round good weather (with the occasional but sometimes serious exception of hurricane season in the late summer and early fall), promotional air fares from Europe and North America, and hundreds of islands to explore, the Caribbean offers something for almost everyone. [ edit ] Understand The Caribbean islands were first inhabited by the Arawak Indians, then were invaded by a more aggressive tribe, the Caribs. Unfortunately, neither could appreciate their victory forever, although the Arawaks may have had a quiet reign of nearly two millenia. Then the Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, French, Danish, and British arrived, after which the Carib population steeply declined due to various factors. The islands have known many historic battles and more than a few pirate stories. [ edit ] Regions Cuba , Dominican Republic , Haiti , Jamaica , Puerto Rico and the Cayman Islands , often grouped as Greater Antilles , are by far the largest countries in the area and the most visited by travellers.

S'Central America travel guide - Wikitravel Help Wikitravel grow by contributing to an article! Learn how . Central America From Wikitravel North America : Central America Jump to: navigation , search Contents Countries Cities Other destinations Understand Talk [+] Get in By plane By bus Get around See Buy Eat Drink Stay safe Stay healthy Get out Central America is the thin section of land that links the North American continent with the South American continent. Geographically part of North America, it is made up of seven small, mostly tropical countries that have much more in common with South America and Mexico than the more affluent north. Mexico is occasionally considered part of Central America due to the language and cultural heritage it shares with several of the countries in the region. [ edit ] Countries Belize Costa Rica El Salvador Guatemala Honduras Nicaragua Panama [ edit ] Cities Antigua Guatemala Belize City Guatemala City Managua Panama City San Jos\xc3\xa9 San Pedro Sula San Salvador Tegucigalpa [ edit ] Other destinations Cocos Island National Park Coiba National Marine Park Cop\xc3\xa1n Ruinas Corcovado National Park Arenal Volcano Isla Ometepe Mesoamerican Barrier Reef R\xc3\xado Pl\xc3\xa1tano Biosphere Reserve Tikal [ edit ] Understand Until the 1990s, the region, (apart from peaceful Honduras, Belize and Costa Rica), was subject to brutal repression ( Guatemala ), civil wars ( El Salvador and Nicaragua ), and proxy wars between opposite parties supported either by the US or the Soviet Union. This dark political and social situation changed with the end of the Cold War and after the signing of peace agreements at the beginning of the 1990s. Now the region is living a process of change and reforms that will hopefully allow travelers to discover an interesting and relatively cheap travel destination. Generally, the people of Central America are kind and warm, and welcoming to foreigners. There is a diversity of culture from one end of Central America to the other, and indigenous culture plays an important role in the region, especially in Guatemala , El Salvador and Honduras . [ edit ] Talk Due to the extensive Spanish colonial presence in the region, American dialects of Spanish are the primary language, especially of the government and in the cities. (English is the official language of Belize , a former UK colony, but you will still find yourself speaking a lot of Spanish in the country.) Native languages are still spoken in many rural areas. However, English is co-official in Nicaragua\'s Caribbean coast, along with indigenous languages. English speaking people can be found on the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Panama. [ edit ] Get in People from industrialized countries should have no problem in crossing borders and might expect a border fee from around $2-$20 depending on country. When crossing the border, no one will flag you down to get your stamp. You will need to find the immigration office on your own and get your stamp. A visa ahead of time is usually not required [ edit ] By plane Regular cheap flights are available from the United States to Central Americas airports. Very regular buses run from Chetumal in Mexico to the town of Corozal in Belize, a journey lasting one hour and costing around $4 US. You may have to pay an exit tax, or a fee to validate your Mexican visa for multiple entries when you leave Mexico, and there is also an exit tax when you leave Belize.Juan Santamar\xc3\xada airport in Costa Rica also gets flights, from Europe (Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Madrid; US (Miami, Los Angeles, Dallas, New York City, Houston, Phoenix, Charlotte, Orlando, etc). Agusto C. Sandino International Airport in Nicaragua and Comalapa Airport in El Salvador also have many destinations. Because flights directly to Central America from outside the Western Hemisphere are very expensive, it is often cheaper to fly via the U.S. For example, a flight Sydney->Mexico City costs about $2500. If you fly with Jetstar [1] to Hawaii , then with Hawaiian Airlines [2] to LA , and afterwards by bus (or plane) to Mexico City, it will cost less than $1000. [ edit ] By bus It is actually much easier to bus from the United States to Central America than most imagine. It is a distance of about 1000 miles from the US border at Brownsville to the Guatemalan/Mexican border. The trip can be done in one full day (strongly not recommended), instead the wise traveller would take his time and enjoy the many interesting sites along the way such as Real de Catorce , Veracruz , Xalapa , San Cristobal de las Casas , Palenque etc. Bus fare from Brownsville to the Guate border runs about $130 USD currently (Jan 08). From the Guatemalan Border, one can take a bus like the Tica Bus to get to Panama or any of the CA-4 countries for around 130 USD or less. There are no roads leading to Colombia from Central America. [ edit ] Get around If you have money to burn or in a tight shift, TACA and COPA offers good connections throughout the region but its relatively expensive due to the lack of competition. The international travel route leads mostly on the Pacific (west) side of central america. It basically starts south in Panama City , crosses on the Pacific site into Costa Rica , passes by San Jos\xc3\xa9 , crosses again at the Pacific coast into Nicaragua . It is possible to cross the Costa Rican / Panaman border at the Caribbean coast but it takes longer and the border is just open during the day. Between Costa Rica and Nicaragua are two official borders. The more frequented one is "Pe\xc3\xb1as Blancas" at the Pacific side and the other one is between Los Chiles and San Carlos, Nicaragua . Between Nicaragua and Honduras exist three border-crossings. Honduras and El Salvador share various border-crossings as well as Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador . Tica Bus [3] connects all of the Central American countries except Belize. [ edit ][ add listing ] See The Cloud Forest of Cusuco National Park in Honduras . A biodiversity hot spot visited by Operation Wallacea scientific expeditions. The Cloud Forests of Panama in Boquete . Many hotels are actually within the cloud forest; or you can take a tour high in to the mountains, through the clouds. Lake Atitlan in Guatemala . One of the most beautiful spots on the planet. A volcanic lake with three volcanoes around it. Colonial Towns, such as Antigua Guatemala , Quetzaltenango , ( Guatemala ); Juayua , Suchitoto in El Salvador , Gracias and Comayagua ( Honduras ), Le\xc3\xb3n and Granada in Nicaragua (the oldest colonial city in Nicaragua) or Panama City , San Blas Islands -Casco Viejo- ( Panama , where the Panama Canal can be visited as well). Ancient Mayan ruins in Belize , Honduras , Guatemala , and El Salvador . Amazing beaches in Tela,Trujillo, la Ceiba and the Bay Islands (Honduras) the Guanacaste, Puntarenas, and Lim\xc3\xb3n (Costa Rica); Montelimar, San Juan del Sur, Bahia Majagual, La Flor and Pochomil (Nicaragua); Bocas del Toro and El Farall\xc3\xb3n (Panama). Surf, especially in Honduras , Nicaragua , Costa Rica , and El Salvador . National Natural Parks, especially in El Salvador , Costa Rica , Panama and Nicaragua which has the 2nd largest rainforest in the Western Hemisphere, after Brazil. Volcanoes in Guatemala such as those framing the southern shores of Lake Atitl\xc3\xa1n considered by some to be one of the most beautiful places on the planet. Semuc Champey and the Lanquin caves in the Alta Verapaz District of Guatemala are unmissable. All these make this region a great yet undiscovered and affordable treasure which is worth visiting. [ edit ][ add listing ] Buy Just about every country in Central America accepts the U.S. Dollar. Other currencies are difficult to exchange. You can exchange Mexican Peso at the Belize Border or Guatemalan Border but that is about it. The U.S. Dollar is the official currency of El Salvador and Panama so there is no need to exchange money in these countries. You can buy pretty much anything or any service in U.S. dollars, but it might be sometimes cheaper to buy in the local currency. Currencies such as the C\xc3\xb3rdoba or the Lempira are usually highly inflated so only get what you need. Nearly all banks change money from U.S. Dollar to the local currency and a passport is usually required to do this. Beyond border towns, currencies are always useless when brought outside the country to change money with official money changers at borders. If bringing U.S. Cash to Central America, make sure that the bills are new, clean and not torn or it may not be exchanged. $2 bills are considered lucky so bring some for tips. Banks in Belize do not exchange the Guatemalan Quetzal; they must be changed at the border or at some travel agents and tour operators. ATMs can be found in banks and in major towns but in the country side it is often hard to find working ATMs. Most ATMs dispence the local currency and U.S. dollars. In Central America, you can often find cheap buys from gifts to personal necessities. Almost everything can be bargained for except for upscale department stores. Tourists will usually pay a higher price so this is where your haggling will be useful. [ edit ][ add listing ] Eat Guatemala is the country of tamales, there are regular tamales made out of corn "masa" with either meat, chicken, turkey or pork filling and tomato, and sometimes "chile". "Black tamales" are similar to the former ones but are sweet, "paches" are tamales made out of potatos, "tamales de cambray" are small sweet "masa" balls", tamales de "chipilin", and many others; rellenitos (sweet fried bean-stuffed banana bonbons) are a tasty dessert sold on streetcorners. Black beans are the main staple after corn of course. There is a variety of soups ("caldos"). Guatemalan cuisine is a mixture of Mayan and Spanish dishes. Gallo pinto is a mixture of rice and beans with a little cilantro or onion thrown in, it is the national dish of Nicaragua and Costa Rica This mixture is called Casamiento ("marriage")in El Salvador and Guatemala. And on the north coast of Honduras, casamiento is made with coconut milk. Pupusas and "chicharron con yuca" (pork skin & yucca) are very popular dishes originated in El Salvador. Nacatamales, which are big tamales containing pork, potato, rice, chile, tomato, and masa is steamed in platano leaves, they originate from Nicaragua and can be bought in the colonial city of Granada. Oven tamales, wraped with platano leaves, are very good in Costa Rica. Grilled octopus is a very tasty dish in Panama. [ edit ][ add listing ] Drink Horchata is a drink made out of rice and it is of Spanish origin. It is drunk in most Latin American countries. A popular drink in most central american countries is "Rosa de Jamaica" (Hibiscus sabdariffa. "Tamarindo" also makes a very popular drink Pi\xc3\xb1a Colada, a drink made from pineapple juice, coconut cream, crushed ice and rum, is drunk all around the Atlantic islands. There are two major rum producers in Guatemala, distilling some of the best rums of the region, Ron Zacapa Centenario (aged to 12 and 23 years) and Ron Botran a\xc3\xb1ejo (25 years). Flor de Ca\xc3\xb1a, rated one of the best rums in Latin America. It is made in Chichigalpa, Nicaragua. Trips can also be made to visit the Flor de Ca\xc3\xb1a factory. [ edit ] Stay safe Nicaragua , Panama and Costa Rica are generally safer than Honduras , Guatemala , El Salvador , and Belize , which suffer from the maras (street gangs) and also have the highest crime rates in the region. The police are often not seen as reliable or trustworthy. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights reported last year that Guatemala had the highest murder rate in all of Latin America , with 70.0 homicides per 100,000. In comparison, the murder rate in the United States is 5.6 homicides per 100,000. Night travel is dangerous anywhere in Central America, especially in national capitals. Illegal drugs are common in the region so stay clear! Crossing into South America overland might seem like a good idea when you look at a world map, however, it\'s not. The border to Colombia in Panama\'s Darien province is surrounded by a dangerous wilderness and the only break in the Pan-American Highway . Known as the Darien Gap, this is the playground of ruthless drug smugglers and militias who will be happy to kidnap or kill you. Unless you\'re a movie Predator, stay away. [ edit ] Stay healthy Toilets are not always as readily available as what you may be used to in your own country, so take advantage of places where they are such as museums and restaurants. In many cases toilet paper will not be provided so it is best not to be caught short and carry your own. Water to wash hands is not always available so carrying antiseptic hand gel is a good idea. Trash cans are provided in all toilets for the disposal of toilet paper because the sewage systems in Central America cannot cope with it. Mosquitos are quite common even in the dry season and bug spray is often hard to come by. Bring a spray high in DEET. To be extra safe, bring a bug net to sleep under. Malaria pills are a good idea but often expensive. See Tips for travel in developing countries [ edit ] Get out This article is an outline and needs more content.

Due to additional stops, the Hikari takes 3 hours and 40 minutes to reach Himeji from Tokyo. An inexpensive method of reaching Himeji from within the Kansai region is to take one of the frequent Shinkaisoku (\xe6\x96\xb0\xe5\xbf\xab\xe9\x80\x9f - Special Rapid) commuter trains on the JR Kobe line (JR \xe7\xa5\x9e\xe6\x88\xb8\xe7\xb7\x9a) that begins in Osaka, which charges only the price of a local train. The ride takes 38 minutes from Kobe \'s Sannomiya station (\xc2\xa5950) or 57 minutes from Osaka (\xc2\xa51450). It is possible to travel from Osaka to Himeji using direct trains over the private Hanshin and Sanyo Railways but as this takes longer than JR (one and a half hours, \xc2\xa51250) it is only really worthwhile for holders of the 3 day or 5 day pass for Kansai\'s private railway system. From Kyoto , the Hikari shinkansen whisks travellers to Himeji in just under an hour. This trip can be taken without charge by Japan Rail Pass holders. [ edit ] By bus Shinki Bus runs an overnight service from Tokyo ( Shinjuku and Shibuya ) to Himeji at a cost of \xc2\xa59450 one way and \xc2\xa517010 round trip. As of October 2009, the bus leaves the Shinjuku Highway Bus Terminal at 22:30 and arrives at the Himeji Bus Terminal at 8:00, with the return leaving Himeji at 21:30 and getting to Shinjuku at 7:00. [ edit ] Get around [ edit ] On foot To see the castle, as well as many of the other sites, it\'s only a 10-15 minute walk down Otemae-d\xc5\x8dri from the station. Along the way, you\'ll also pass shopping centers and souvenir shops. [ edit ] By bus The Sightseeing Loop Bus is a cheap and convenient alternative that makes a loop around the cultural area, with stops near the castle, garden, and museums. It only costs \xc2\xa5100 to ride, regardless of where you get off. It only takes 5 minutes to get to the castle. The Loop Bus only covers the area around the castle, so for those wanting to visit sites beyond this area, such as Engyoji, you will need to take the city bus. [ edit ][ add listing ] See Himeji Castle gun racks Himeji Castle ( \xe5\xa7\xab\xe8\xb7\xaf\xe5\x9f\x8e Himeji-j\xc5\x8d ), ( An easy 10-minute walk north from the station; also accessible by bus. ), [2] . The castle is open 9 AM to 5 PM daily (admission is only until 4 PM) or until 6 PM (admission is until 5 PM) from June until August. The castle is closed between December 29 \xe2\x80\x93 31.) . Dating to 1609 and also graced with the name "White Egret Castle" (\xe7\x99\xbd\xe9\xb7\xba\xe5\x9f\x8e Shirasagi-j\xc5\x8d ), this striking white edifice is generally considered the most beautiful of Japan\'s castles and is one of the few that has escaped the ravages of civil war, earthquakes and firebombings. Most notably, the castle miraculously survived World War II virtually unscathed, despite the rest of the city having been levelled by American carpet bombing. The castle was designated as a national treasure in 1931 and was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1993. It is virtually the last castle in Japan that still manages to tower over the surrounding skyscrapers and office buildings. Admission is \xc2\xa5600 adults and \xc2\xa5200 children. A special \xc2\xa5720 combination ticket gets you into both the castle and the nearby K\xc5\x8dkoen Garden. A free guided tour in English is included \'\'if\'\' a guide happens to be available (no reservations are possible) . \xc2\xa0 edit NOTE: Himeji Castle is currently undergoing renovation until spring 2015 . It will stay open throughout, but parts may be off-limits and a large tent-like structure is covering the entire main building of castle. As of Sept 1, 2011 , the interior of the main keep was closed to visitors, and the structure itself is covered up. For an additional 200 yen on top of the 300 yen entry fee, you can take an elevator to the top of the main keep to see the work in progress. A series of other parts of the castle complex have been opened up to compensate including some that are generally not open to the public. Although the image of the castle towering over the city is a key reason many people visit Himeji, the covered-up castle is still worth a visit. A live image of the castle may be seen here: http://www.winknet.ne.jp/ K\xc5\x8dkoen Garden ( \xe5\xa5\xbd\xe5\x8f\xa4\xe5\x9c\x92 kokoen ), ( Located right next to the western edge of Himeji Castle\'s outer moat ), [3] . Open from 9 AM daily and closes at either 5 PM or 6PM (last admission at 4:30 PM or 5:30 PM) depending on the time of year . This magnificent collection of nine Edo-period-style walled gardens was laid out in 1992 on a site where samurai houses once stood. The street plan and gated partitions preserve the appearance of the old residential quarter, except that within the various enclosures visitors find beautifully landscaped gardens and water features instead of noble residences. There is a tea arbour and a restaurant within the grounds, but eating and drinking outside of these places is prohibited. Admission is \xc2\xa5300 adults and \xc2\xa5150 children. A special \xc2\xa5720 combination ticket gets you into both K\xc5\x8dkoen and Himeji Castle . \xc2\xa0 edit Hyogo Prefectural Museum of History , ( Across the street from Himeji City Museum of Art ), [4] . Open from 10 AM to 5 PM. Closed Mondays . Unlike most prefectural museums, this one actually has very little information about Hyogo prefecture\'s history, and historical artifacts also tend to be lacking, so if you really want to learn more about Hyogo, you may be disappointed however, if you are interested in Japanese history as a whole, this museum is well worth visiting. It contains replicas of all twelve original castles remaining in Japan, has a room dedicated to festivals (while they feature Hyogo festivals, most are done nationwide), and toys throughout history. There is an art gallery, as well, which often features some of Japan\'s most interesting artwork. The artwork is not limited to Hyogo artists. Check the website to see what will be displayed when you arrive. Entrance fee \xc2\xa5200 yen (adult), \xc2\xa5150 college and high school students. During special exhibitions admission changes, typically to around \xc2\xa5700. . \xc2\xa0 edit Himeji City Museum of Art , \xe2\x98\x8e 079-222-2288 . Open 10AM to 5PM . Features artwork from local artists and European art, along with special exhibitions. \xc2\xa5200 (prices are raised during special exhibitions) . \xc2\xa0 edit Senhime Shrine , ( On the flank of Otokoyama, towards the castle ). This is the only shrine in Japan associated with a castle. While the shrine itself is rather small and not very interesting, travelling up the stairs to the next lookout reveals a spectacular view of Himeji Castle. \xc2\xa0 edit Himeji City Zoo , 68 Honmachi, Himeji, 670-0012 ( In the park in front of the castle. ), \xe2\x98\x8e 079-284-3636 , [5] . 9am-5pm . This zoo has a pretty comprehensive array of animals, but usually only one of each and all in very small cages or enclosures. Entry Y200 . \xc2\xa0 edit Engyo-ji Temple , ( A 30 minute bus ride from Himeji castle on the orange bus #8 ). The beautiful temple complex is best known among the locals as the setting for part of Tom Cruise\'s "The Last Samurai". Mount Shosha, where the temple complex is located, is particularly beautiful in the fall, when the Japanese maples change colors. \xc2\xa5300 entrance + \xc2\xa5900 cable car return trip . \xc2\xa0 edit Tegarayama , southwest of Himeji castle, with an aquarium and small amusement park. Asago Sculpture Park , 30 minutes by car or train is a large sculpture park and museum. [ edit ][ add listing ] Do Himeji Castle is particularly striking (and crowded) in cherry blossom season in April, when all the trees planted in and around the castle burst into white splendor. Most people visit only the Castle and the area between the castle and the station. However, the area around the castle is a great place for a refreshing walk or a picnic. For families in particular, the park behind Himeji castle offers a decent play structure and ample space to sit down and have a picnic in the shadow of Japan\'s most famous castle. Nada Matsuri Aboshi Matsuri Himeji Ceramics market Himeji has a number of matsuri (festivals) throughout the year. Cherry Blossom Viewing Party , usually around the second Sunday in April. Lots of koto and taiko drumming. Yukata Matsuri - mid June, runs 2-3 days. Locals criticize this festival for having no roots or real reason to exist other than an opportunity for girls to dress up in summer yukata, eat delicious food from booths, and play fair games. Which is a good enough reason to go. This festival is always packed and makes for great people-watching, as many kinds of Japanese subcultures are on display. Oshiro Matsuri - early august. A large parade down the main street ending at Himeji castle. There is also a big stage to see lots of dancing, which can range from either very traditional to very hip. Often it\'s a combination of the two. Moon viewing - in September near the time of the Harvest moon. Features traditional plays and drums. [ edit ][ add listing ] Buy Himeji isn\'t particularly famous for crafts or goods. Wind chimes made of iron tongs and white leather accessories are popular higher-end Himeji souvenirs, and they can be bought in many of the department stores or along the Miyuki dori shopping arcade. There are also numerous shops along the route to the castle selling a variety of Himeji Castle and other assorted souvenirs. Additionally, the streets in the area surrounding Himeji Station are filled with shopping arcades (particularly Miyuki dori) and the usual department stores (there are several lining the way to the Castle, including Sanyo, Forus, and Yamatoyashiki.) Plie , located inside Himeji station. There are two sections. The section next to the North exit consists of women\'s clothing stores, zakka (home goods) stores, and a large Junkudo book shop. The other section consists of some omiyage (food gift) shops and a few restaurants like McDonald\'s and KFC. Sanyo department store , part of Sanyo station (North of Himeji JR station, on the West side of the main street). A standard department store with a variety of goods on multiple floors, including a small LOFT (a popular chain of stores that sells hip accessories, stickers, home goods and pop culture items). Festa , located on the northeast corner outside of Himeji station, has a small selection of stores. Animate , running perpendicular to the shopping arcade next to Miyukidori (turn at the 7-11 and taiyaki corner shops), Animate has two floors for those into anime and manga. The ground floor has a large selection of manga and doujinshi for all tastes and ages. The second floor has anime goods, CD soundtracks, and DVDs. Bon Marche , there are two in the station area, one on Miyukidori close to the castle, and one tucked behind and between Sanyo department store and Mitsubishi UFJ Bank (left hand side of Otemae dori). These gourmet grocery stores stock an impressive (though sometimes pricey) selection of foods, including some import foods. Daiso , located above the Bon Marche behind Sanyo department store, is arguably the largest 100-yen store in Himeji. This store is made up of three floors, and sell goods that run the gamut from housewares to clothes, electronics to food - most (but not all) available for \xc2\xa5100 apiece. A great place to pick up cheap souvenirs for your friends back home, but getting there and getting out can be a bit inconvenient. Additionally, for those who prefer the finer smokeables, there is a tobacco shop just off of Miyuki dori (turn right at the Fujifilm corner shop) on the right hand side just past the Softbank store that, in an unusual move for Japanese tobacconists, sells a variety of cigars. Not the top quality Cubans, mind you, but decent enough (and rare-in-Japan) "hamaki" (cigars). [ edit ][ add listing ] Eat As you exit the station facing the castle (North), the main shopping street (Miyuki dori) will be on your right and the main entertainment area on your left. Both areas have some fine restaurants. Himeji has a full selection of foods, from fast food (Western and Japanese) to gourmet dining. For breakfast there are countless coffee shops, including a Starbucks that has small waffles. Vegetarians in Himeji would do well to visit either Baobab or Everest. Baobab is a pan-Asian restaurant with an English menu for lunch and dinner, located just east of SMBC bank on Miyuki-dori, the main shopping arcade. Everest is a Nepalese (and Indian) restaurant just West of Himeji Station. Everest also has an English menu and the owner and chef also speaks English fluently. Koba and More , a small ramen shop with a jazz theme that is famous among the local expat crowd for its unusual Milk Ramen. Koba is the owner and ramen chef. Open 11:30-2:30 for lunch and 7:00-11:00 for dinner (6:00-11:00 on Saturdays). Closed on Thursdays. Walking towards the castle on the main road (Otemae-Dori), Take a right when you get to Yamato Yashiki department store. Take the second left. Kobe and More is on the left, look for the hanging beaded curtain. Sakura-saku , Honmachi 68, Himeji 670-0917. Vegetarian-friendly restaurant (also a kind of greengrocer\'s) with nice open-air frontage and view of Himeji castle. You can get a fantastic veggie meal of (for example) rice with peas, tofu steak and pumpkin, pickles, soup, dessert with coffee, and all the green tea you can drink, all for \xc2\xa51000. From the intersection in front of the castle, facing towards JR Himeji station, walk down the main street towards the station, go right at the first set of traffic lights you reach, and it\'s a few buildings down on your left. Starbucks , Located on the first floor of the Forus shopping building. Subway , the American sandwich chain, is a 5-minute walk north from JR Himeji station on Miyuki dori. There is a 24 hour McDonald\'s on the east side of Himeji JR station, for those of you who fancy something quick, simple and recognizable. [ edit ][ add listing ] Drink Himeji has two main bars that cater to foreigners. These bars tend to be frequented mostly by foreigners living in the city. Nobu , [6] . Nobu is a tiny, cramped little bar with English-speaking Japanese and foreign staff. It may be small; but Nobu is a friendly place. This bar is frequented mainly by a younger crowd, mostly English teachers. Hosanna Irish/British Pub . The city\'s resident Irish Pub, except that the city\'s small Irish population tend to avoid it at all costs. Serving good food in a warm and relaxing setting, Hosanna is expensive and a bit lifeless but some members of the staff speak very good English. [ edit ][ add listing ] Sleep Most people visit Himeji as a day/half day trip. Like most Japanese cities, there are a number of inexpensive business hotels clustered around the station. For example: Toyoko Inn , 97 Minami-Ekimae-cho , [7] . This simple business hotel is located right next to the train station. Rooms are smallish, but the price includes internet in the room and Japanese-style breakfast. (Double room \xc2\xa58,000) \xc2\xa0 edit Hotel Nikko Himeji ( Ekimae ), ( South side of the JR train station ). The Nikko Himeji (along with a few other hotels) is on the side of the JR station opposite the castle. There is now a convenient central underpass in the station with a number of shops, linking the castle- and the sea-sides of the city (previously, to get over the tracks meant either a long walk or the purchasing of a train ticket!). The Hotel Nikko is a pleasant hotel for the business traveler (although possibly pricey for those on a budget - about \xc2\xa512,000 as of 10/2008). \xc2\xa0 edit Floral Inn , \xe3\x80\x92670-0965\xe3\x80\x80\xe5\x85\xb5\xe5\xba\xab\xe7\x9c\x8c\xe5\xa7\xab\xe8\xb7\xaf\xe5\xb8\x82\xe6\x9d\xb1\xe5\xbb\xb6\xe6\x9c\xab3\xe4\xb8\x81\xe7\x9b\xae56\xe7\x95\xaa\xe5\x9c\xb0 ( About five minutes walk south of the station ), \xe2\x98\x8e 079-222-8000 , [8] .

S'Middle East travel guide - Wikitravel Help Wikitravel grow by contributing to an article! Learn how . Middle East From Wikitravel Asia : Middle East Jump to: navigation , search Contents Countries and territories Cities Other destinations [+] Understand Cultural geography [+] Get in By plane By boat [+] Get around By plane By car By train By bus Talk [+] See Itineraries Do Learn Buy Eat Drink Sleep Stay safe Stay healthy Contact Get out Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem The Middle East is a world region in Western Asia and North-eastern Africa. The term was created by British military strategists in the 19th century, and definitions of the Middle East vary; it is not simply a geographical term, but also a political one, connoting that it separates Europe ("the West") from the Far East, and the traditional trade route of choice between these two extremes. [ edit ] Countries and territories Map of the Middle East Bahrain Iran Iraq Israel Jordan Kuwait Lebanon Oman Palestinian Territories Qatar Saudi Arabia Syria Turkey United Arab Emirates Yemen Egypt is often considered a part of the Middle East, as the Sinai is geologically a part of Asia . Sometimes Azerbaijan is considered a part of the Middle East, as a sort of border region between Europe and Asia . Even the inclusion of Iran is to a degree controversial\xe2\x80\x94it can also be considered to be a Central Asian or South Asian nation. [ edit ] Cities Traditional boats backed by the quickly rising skyline of Dubai Tehran \xe2\x80\x94 a bustling metropolis of 14 million people, it is a cosmopolitan city, with great museums, parks, restaurants and warm friendly people, also great Iranian food\xc2\xa0!

Ethnically, the region is extremely mixed. Arabs, Jewish people, Persians and Turks are the largest groups, but there are several substantial minorities \xe2\x80\x94 Kurds, Armenians and others \xe2\x80\x94 with their own languages, customs and sometimes their own countries. Every invading army \xe2\x80\x94 from Alexander and the Romans through Genghis Khan to the 19th century colonial powers \xe2\x80\x94 has left descendants behind. There are also substantial numbers of workers from other countries coming to the region for higher pay \xe2\x80\x94 mainly Afghan, Pakistani for jobs like construction labourer, with Egyptians, Filipinos, more Pakistanis, and some westerners in the more skilled jobs. Almost every country in the Middle East has a Muslim majority (with the notable exception of Israel which has a Jewish majority), with Iran , Iraq and Bahrain mainly Shia, other areas mainly Sunni, and both with minorities of the other \xe2\x80\x94 and the legal systems in most of these countries are influenced by Islamic Law; a few are entirely based on it. [ edit ] Cultural geography North Africa is similar to the Middle East in many ways \xe2\x80\x94 language, religion, culture and some ethnic groups. Some writers include Egypt , or even Sudan and Libya , in their use of the term "Middle East". On the other side, Central Asia also has much in common with the Middle East. Ethnic groups and languages are different, but the religion, much of the food, clothing, and architecture are similar. Iran could be counted as part of either region; at one point most of Central Asia was part of the Persian Empire. The border between southeastern Europe and the Middle East is also unclear. Many writers include Turkey in their usage of "Middle East" and we include it above, but parts of Turkey are very much European. Large parts of Turkey and all of Lebanon and Israel are also clearly Mediterranean regions. On the other hand, several countries usually considered European \xe2\x80\x94 Greece , Cyprus and to some extent the Balkans \xe2\x80\x94 also have Middle Eastern aspects to their culture. [ edit ] Get in [ edit ] By plane The largest hub for flights in the region is Dubai , from where you can reach virtually any point in the Middle East. After Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi also have good intercontinental connections. Tel Aviv is served by flights from most Western countries, though due to the political situation, it is not possible to fly from there to anywhere in the Middle East besides Egypt and Jordan. However, there are direct flights from large European hubs to most major cities in the region. [ edit ] By boat See Ferries in the Mediterranean . [ edit ] Get around Public transport is poor compared to other regions of the world including other parts of Asia. The majority of locals would use plane or car travel to get between countries. [ edit ] By plane [ edit ] By car Should you wish to enter Bahrain on land, the only way is via the King Fahd Causeway which extends from Saudi Arabia into Bahrain. Bear in mind that while Bahrain issues visas on arrival, provisions for this in Saudi Arabia are not available to non Gulf nation passport holders. [ edit ] By train Rail travel in the Middle East is limited and whilst most countries have limited passenger services between cities, there is very little between countries. Istanbul is the best starting point for rail journeys to a lot of areas in the Middle East. From here, a service to Aleppo in Syria operates from which one can take a connecting service to Damascus . There is a train that connects Damascus with Amman in Jordan. A service from Istanbul also operates to Tehran which includes a 4 hour ferry journey across Lake Van. In general, these trains tend to operate weekly or at most bi weekly. All other countries in this region have no international rail services. [ edit ] By bus This is a more practical option than trains in the Middle East as they are less prone to delays and breakdowns and have far more extensive coverage of the region. [ edit ] Talk Arabic is the primary language of the region, and the main language in all Middle Eastern countries except Iran (where Persian predominates), Turkey ( Turkish ) and Israel ( Hebrew ). Even in those countries, Arabic is fairly common as a second language; in Israel, Arabic is a second official language. Yiddish , Ladino , Kurdish , Azeri , Armenian and several other languages are also spoken in some regions. English is moderately common in tourist areas and generally rare elsewhere. In Turkey, some German is spoken because many Turks work in Germany and Austria. [ edit ][ add listing ] See High-rises made of mud in Shibam , Yemen \xe2\x80\x94"Manhattan of the Desert" [ edit ] Itineraries From Istanbul to Cairo classic overland route Hajj \xe2\x80\x94 the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina Ferries across the Red Sea [ edit ][ add listing ] Do [ edit ] Learn [ edit ][ add listing ] Buy Iranian (Also known as Persian) Carpet Iranian Pistachio Iranian Saffron Iranian Caviar [ edit ][ add listing ] Eat A fancy Arabic mixed grill. Clockwise from top: lamb kofta , chicken shish tawuk , beef shish kebab , rozz (Arabic rice), vegetables. Cookery provides obvious evidence of the extent of Middle Eastern influence. Turkish doner kebab , Greek gyros and the shawarma of the Arab countries (everywhere from Oman to Morocco) are all basically the same dish. A traveller going overland from Europe to India will find very similar dishes \xe2\x80\x94 notably flat breads and kebabs \xe2\x80\x94 in every country from Greece to India. These are also seen in Central Asia and even China . Many Greek dishes are closer to Iranian cooking than to Italian.also you can eat Iranian (Persian) great foods like\xc2\xa0: Ghorme Sabzi or Dizi [ edit ][ add listing ] Drink [ edit ][ add listing ] Sleep [ edit ] Stay safe Planning a visit to the Middle East can be complicated in various ways: Some countries and territories in the area, such as Iraq , Syria , and the Gaza Strip , are in a state of war or civil war and should not be visited. See War zone safety if you must go. Some countries, such as Saudi Arabia , do not issue tourist visas except for a few expensive tours. Some countries in the region have very strict Islamic Law, with heavy penalties for homosexuality , adultery and other "offenses". Many countries in the region do not recognize the state of Israel for many reasons. These nations may refuse you entry if you have an Israeli visa or an Israeli stamp in your passport, or even a visa for another country that was issued in Israel. The Israeli authorities will generally help you avoid these problems by providing a visa as a separate document so it is not in your passport, however now this has been discontinued; see the Israel article for details. Only Turkey , Egypt and Jordan have official relations with Israel in the region. For most of the area, suggestions in Tips for travel in developing countries apply. [ edit ] Stay healthy [ edit ] Contact [ edit ] Get out Turkey and Cyprus \xe2\x80\x94 with lots of border posts and extensive transportation alternatives, southern Turkey is well linked to Syria . It may also be possible to take cruises to the island nation of Cyprus from Syria as well as Lebanon . Egypt \xe2\x80\x94 with buses from Israel and ferries from Jordan , Egypt is an easy trip from the region. South Asia \xe2\x80\x94 the "Hippie Trail" , after traversing Turkey and Iran from one end to another (and dipping into Iraq at a time in history) goes onward to Pakistan . Central Asia \xe2\x80\x94 an off the beaten path destination, which is accessible by buses from the Iranian city of Mashhad (which terminate in Turkmenistan and Afghanistan ). Caucasus \xe2\x80\x94 the lush and beautiful Caucasus is a short hop north from Iran. This article is an outline and needs more content.

North America From Wikitravel Jump to: navigation , search Contents [+] Countries and continental sections Territories Cities Other destinations Understand Get in [+] Get around By air By bus By car By train Talk [+] See Itineraries Do Buy Eat Drink Sleep Stay safe Stay healthy Contact North America is a part of the continent named America, after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci, with a surface area of 24,221,490 sq km (9,351,969 sq mi). It is located in the northern hemisphere, between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean and to the north of South America . North America\'s highest point is Alaska\'s Mount McKinley, which rises to 6,194 m (20,320 ft) above sea level. [ edit ] Countries and continental sections North America consists of three large nations and one large island territory that covers most of its area. They are Canada , the United States of America (USA), Mexico and Greenland . There are also seven smaller nations at its southern extreme (collectively known as Central America ), around two dozen island nations and territories of various sizes in the Caribbean , and one isolated French territory off the Canadian Atlantic coast. Although the Central American and the Caribbean regions are technically part of the North American continent, they are commonly listed separately from their larger neighbors to the north and hence the distinctive region names for both cultural and geographical reasons. Regions of North America Canada The Great White North certainly has vast expanses of unspoiled wilderness, but it also features some of the world\'s most modern, cosmopolitan cities. Caribbean White sandy beaches, crystal-clear water, and laid-back island culture make the Caribbean one of the world\'s top vacation spots. Central America The seven nations of this isthmus connecting North and South America blend elements of both continents; you\'ll find bustling cities, ancient jungle ruins, and Spanish-tinged mestizo and Afro-Indian cultures. Greenland A self-governing country, but officially still part of Denmark , Greenland is a vast island of stark landscapes and midnight sun. Mexico Mexico is a big tourist attraction for sun-seekers and historians alike; the former flock to Mexico\'s tropical beaches, while the latter find the artifacts of the ancient Aztec and Mayan civilization fascinating. United States of America One of the largest, most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations on Earth includes some of the world\'s most famous cities, natural parks of unspeakable beauty, and virtually everything in between.

[ edit ] By bus There is prolific long range bus service across most of the US and Canada, but travel times are excessively long (on the order of three to five times as long as a direct trip in a personal vehicle) and many stations are relatively unsafe. Most bus service is useful only for traveling within a dense metro area or along major commuter routes and is then limited or unavailable outside of business hours. [ edit ] By car Most travel in Canada, the United States, and Mexico is by personal vehicle. Almost all highways in Canada and the United States are well maintained, with amenities such as gas, food, and lodging ranging from adequate to very convenient to excessive. If you experience an emergency that endangers your life, safety, or property, you will be able to dial 911 from a compatible cell phone on almost any major highway and reach an operator at any time. Vehicle and medical insurance issued in either Canada or the U.S. is usually valid in the other, though the wise traveler will confirm with their insurer. Canada and U.S. insurance coverage in Mexico is sometimes limited or not honored. Again, the wise traveler will confirm with their insurer. Car rental agencies are available at almost every airport. Usually a major credit card and proof of liability insurance is required. Some agencies offer short term insurance and additional coverage. [ edit ] By train Although it once held much of the continent together, and remains useful for local travel in many metro areas, intercity train travel now ranges from relatively convenient in the Northeast Corridor, to manageable in California and parts of southeastern Canada, to sparse in other parts of the continent. If you prefer to travel by rail, it\'s still possible (depending on where you go), but it offers neither speed nor convenience. As noted above, the exception is the Northeast Corridor area, which links Washington, D.C. to Boston with frequent stops in intermediate cities such as Baltimore , Philadelphia , New York City , New Haven , and Providence . It is explained in detail on the Rail travel in North America article. [ edit ] Talk The United States and the majority of Canada are majority English speaking countries and is by far the best language for getting around these vast countries. English is also spoken in many Caribbean nations and the small country of Belize. Mexico and the majority of Central America and portions of the Caribbean are majority Spanish speaking making it an important North American language as well. Spanish is spoken as a second language in many parts of the United States. French plays a substantial role in Canada, (including Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, and New Brunswick), and a key role in other places, namely the Caribbean. Dutch is spoken in the southern Caribbean. Several indigenous languages are spoken by Native Americans and the Inuit peoples of North America including in Greenland, Alaska and Nunavut. Danish is also spoken in Greenland. Other important immigrant languages spoken in many ethnic neighborhoods of North America are Cantonese, Mandarin, and Tagalog. German is still spoken in rural communities of the Amish. The three major languages of North America are English, Spanish and French.

Oceania From Wikitravel Jump to: navigation , search Contents Regions Cities Other destinations [+] Understand European influence Common cultural heritage Ecology [+] Get in By plane By boat [+] Get around By plane By ship See [+] Do In the water On land Eat Drink Stay safe Stay healthy Oceania is a vast, arbitrarily defined expanse of the world where the Pacific Ocean \xe2\x80\x93 rather than land borders \xe2\x80\x93 connects the nations. It is home to glistening white beaches, coconut palms swaying in the breeze, beautiful coral reefs, and rugged volcanic islands rising out of the blue ocean. Its diverse nations have both some of the world\'s most cosmopolitan and internationalised cities such as Melbourne , and some of its most remote and culturally isolated villages. [ edit ] Regions Australia , New Zealand and Papua New Guinea are by far the largest countries in this continent with the first two the most visited. Oceania also includes the vast island nation groupings of Polynesia to the far east, Melanesia in the west and Micronesia to the north. Australia By far the largest and most populous country in Oceania. New Zealand A major destination, with well-developed facilities for travellers. Technically part of Polynesia as the indigenous Maori are Polynesian and providing the major air hub to the rest of Polynesia Papua New Guinea Tropical rainforest, great scenery and culture. An adventurous, rarely visited, travel destination. Polynesia No other name quite conjures up images of paradise like this one. Stunning paradisical islands sprawling for thousands of miles across the remote South Pacific. Melanesia Closely related to the ethno-cultural makeup of the oft-included Papua New Guinea, Melanesia is home to the always popular destination of Fiji . Micronesia The tiny Micronesian islands fall on or north of the Equator, and see less tourist and business travel than the rest of the island groupings. If looking for a really pretty destination, aim for Palau .

At one time it was envisaged that the two colonies would become a single country. Papua New Guinea was, at one time, a United Nations trusteeship, administered by Australia. Various islands have been annexed by Britain, Spain, Portugal, Germany, France, Australia and the United States. This has had an influence on the aspects of culture. Many areas speak both an indigenous language, and the language of the colonial power, often mixing in interesting blends. There has also been an influence on the food and architecture. [ edit ] Common cultural heritage [ edit ] Ecology Ecologically, Oceania also includes the eastern parts of Indonesia as far as Lombok and Sulawesi . [ edit ] Get in [ edit ] By plane Crystal blue sea off the coast of Samoa . See the country articles for detailed information on how to Get in . The major countries of Australia and New Zealand do of course offer connections from all continents, although there are few direct flights from South America. There are some other gateways offering other opportunities to get in to Oceania, and for interesting itineraries. Air France connects New Caledonia direct with Tokyo and Paris and also flies to Tahiti . Onward connections to Sydney and Auckland are possible. Air Pacific connects Fiji with Los Angeles with connections through to Sydney , Auckland and Tahiti . Tahiti is connected to Los Angeles , and you can fly to the Cook Islands direct from there. Air New Zealand provides a service to Tonga and Samoa from Los Angeles and Auckland. The Los Angeles service is subsidized by the New Zealand government as a form of aid to the the two countries. Manila , Guam and Honolulu offer a gateway to many countries of Micronesia, mainly on Continental Airlines. The smallest islands with less tourism present additional challenges to get to. Many are entirely deserted, and some have restictions on access. [ edit ] By boat A South Pacific cruise. [ edit ] Get around [ edit ] By plane Without a yacht, or a lot of time, the only way for travellers to get around between the main destinations of Oceania is by plane. Sydney , Brisbane , Auckland , and Los Angeles have good connectivity to the region. It is usually possible to fly from the west coast of the United States through to Sydney or Auckland via Hawaii , Tahiti , Fiji or even the Cook Islands . However, air routes tend to come and go depending on whether the airlines find them profitable or not. Much of Micronesia, having been under US Administration, is serviced by Continental Airlines. Much of English-speaking Polynesia receives regular flights from Air New Zealand. Melanesia is mainly serviced by national and Australian airlines. Don\'t expect daily flights. Patience is required. Flying between Micronesia and the other two areas is problematic and may involve flying all the way to Honolulu or a complicated route through Manila, Sydney and Auckland. Continental Airlines has (January 2011) a weekly flight from Guam to Nadi in Fiji . Some flight options within Oceania, amongst others, are: Guam has connections through to the United States , Japan , and a usually very expensive connection to Cairns in Far North Queensland and to Fiji . Cook Islands has connections to Tahiti . Tahiti has flights to Auckland . Fiji has connections to Tahiti , Solomon Islands , Samoa , Guam , Tuvalu , Kiribati and Vanuatu . Solomon Islands has connections through to Fiji and Vanuatu . Vanuatu has connections through to Fiji and New Caledonia . New Caledonia has flights to Auckland . The Tonga , Samoa and Fiji triangle is fairly well connected, although there is only one flight a week each way between Samoa and Tonga at present. [ edit ] By ship There are some options for boats, cruise ships, private yachts, adventure cruises, and even cargo ships. Consult the guide for the destination you are visiting. [ edit ][ add listing ] See Neiafu harbour, Vava\'u , in Tonga All island groups are fascinating and with time and money you can spend months just travelling around. There are some stunningly beautiful islands ( Samoa , Cook Islands , French Polynesia ), some fascinating cultures and festivals, some wonderful diving and totally deserted beaches. Check the individual country sections for details. [ edit ][ add listing ] Do [ edit ] In the water Coral and Tropical Fish . There are locations for diving throughout Oceania , for coral and tropical fish, explore the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland , the Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia , Fiji has some reef around Nadi , and specular unspoilt brightly coloured coral on the more remote islands. Samoa is favoured by scuba divers. Cook Islands has accessible reef just off the beach on the main islands. Vanuatu has accessible some accessible reef too, but the facilities there make it more challenging to access than Fiji . Sail. Vava\'u in Tonga is a popular destination for yachts crossing the Pacific. Yachts can also be chartered there. Sub-tropical diving - Diving and snorkelling opportunities still exist even without a tropical reef. Tasmania has some diving spots. [ edit ] On land Skiing and snow sports . New Zealand has reliable winter snowfalls, mostly on the South Island in winter. The Snowy Mountains in New South Wales have the largest ski resorts in the southern hemisphere. [ edit ][ add listing ] Eat Although staple foods from outside the region, such as rice and flour, now have a firm foothold, the traditional staples of roots and tubers remain very important. The cheapest is usually cassava, which also plays a food security role as it can be left in the ground for a long time. Sweet potato is a very important crop and is found in most parts of Oceania with the major producing area being the Higlands of Papua New Guinea . Taro and yam are also widespread. The latter is the most valuable of the roots and tubers and there are many customs associated with its cultivation. In the Sepik area of Papua New Guinea, for example, sex between married couples is supposed to be forbidden while the yams are growing. On the other hand, in the Trobriand Islands the yam harvest is a period of sexual liberty. [ edit ][ add listing ] Drink Kava is a drink produced from the roots of a plant related to the pepper plant and found mainly in Polynesia as well as Fiji and Vanuatu. It has a mildly narcotic effect. Other names include \'awa (Hawai\'i), \'ava (Samoa), yaqona (Fiji), and sakau ( Pohnpei ). Traditionally it is prepared by chewing, grinding or pounding the roots of the kava plant. In Tonga, chewing traditionally had to be done by female virgins. Pounding is done in a large stone with a small log. The product is then added to cold water and consumed as quickly as possible, invariably as part of a group of people sitting around and sharing the cup. Check the rules before taking any out of the country, however, as importing kava can be illegal. [ edit ] Stay safe [ edit ] Stay healthy Vanuatu , Solomon Islands , Papua New Guinea all have malaria risk in parts. Fiji , New Caledonia , the Cook Islands , Samoa and the other islands are malaria free. The islands may be remote but sexual diseases know no boundaries. Usual precautions apply. This is a usable article. It gives a good overview of the region, its sights, and how to get in, as well as links to the main destinations, whose articles are similarly well developed.

S'South America travel guide - Wikitravel Help Wikitravel grow by contributing to an article! Learn how . South America From Wikitravel Jump to: navigation , search Contents Countries and territories Cities Other destinations Understand [+] Get in By plane By car By train By boat [+] Get around Visas By plane By train By bus Talk See Do Buy Eat Drink Sleep Stay safe Stay healthy Contact Machu Picchu in Peru Nestled between the Caribbean, the South Pacific, and the South Atlantic Oceans, South America is the wilder of the Americas and a continent of superlatives. The world\'s biggest rainforest and the largest river (Amazon), the highest mountain range outside Asia (the Andes), remote islands ( Galapagos Islands , Easter Island and Fernando de Noronha ), heavenly beaches (such as in Brazil\'s Northeastern region), wide deserts (Atacama), icy landscapes ( Patagonia & Tierra del Fuego ), the world\'s tallest waterfall (the 979m Angel Falls , in Venezuela) and one of the largest ( Igua\xc3\xa7u Falls , Argentina and Brazil), as well as several other breathtaking natural attractions. Besides, the work of man has also left rare gems on the continent: ruins of ancient civilizations ( Machu Picchu and other Inca cities; the Moais in Easter Island) share the continent with world-class metropolises ( S\xc3\xa3o Paulo , Buenos Aires , Bogot\xc3\xa1 , Caracas , Santiago , Lima and Rio de Janeiro ), outstanding modern architecture ( Brasilia ), European architecture ( Buenos Aires ), the oldest rock paintings in the Americas (at the Serra da Capivara ), strong African heritage (in Salvador , Rio and Montevideo), genuine indigenous ( Bel\xc3\xa9m , Manaus , Cuzco , Lima , La Paz ), charming cities built in the Andes ( Caracas , Medell\xc3\xadn , Quito , Santiago de Chile ) and Eastern culture (S\xc3\xa3o Paulo\'s enormous Japanese community), mingled with the fingerprints of Iberian colonizers. Ushuaia , the world\'s southernmost city and some of its biggest festivities, such as Rio\'s Carnival and Belem\'s Cirio de Nazar\xc3\xa9 , the Tango World Championship, and the Vendimia festival in Argentina, are also part of this incredibly diverse and attractive continent.

Although some particular places are still quite hard to reach (i.e. Paraguay , Suriname , northern Brazil ), the places that you most likely want to go, such as Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro , are more accessible than ever before. From Africa : the only (reliable) options worth considering would be the South African Airways service linking Johannesburg with Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires or the Malaysian Airlines service between both major South African cities and Argentina( Johannesburg via Cape Town to Buenos Aires ). There are also connections between Luanda and Rio de Janeiro, Salvador de Bahia and Recife with Taag Angola Airlines. Do realize that demand between Africa and South America is very limited, so even the aforementioned services are infrequent and fares may be quite high. From Asia : Be prepared for a very long journey, especially if your itinerary includes connecting flights to travel to/beyond the major Asian and South American hubs. There is a Korean Air route between Seoul -Incheon and Sao Paulo (via Los Angeles ). Do note that the Malaysian Airlines flight makes 2 stops en route, while the latter options involve a stop in the United States that will require all passengers, including those in transit, to pass through U.S. customs. Air China has flights between Beijing and S\xc3\xa3o Paulo , via Madrid . Emirates has non-stop flights from Dubai to Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro , this latter continuing services to Buenos Aires . In 2011, Singapore Airlines started flights from Singapore to Sao Paulo via Barcelona . In 2012 Qatar Airways started its daily non-stop service from Doha to S\xc3\xa3o Paulo , continuing services to Buenos Aires . From Australia, New Zealand , and the South Pacific : A somewhat surprising number of options exist. Both Aerolineas Argentinas and LAN Airlines serve Auckland and Sydney from their respective hubs at Buenos Aires and Santiago , while Qantas introduced a non-stop service between Sydney and Santiago on March 2012. LAN also operates one of the world\'s most obscure flights of all - a service linking Santiago - Easter Island - Tahiti . From Perth Emirates provides affordable flights to Buenos Aires with a stopover in Dubai, around 30 hours total flying time. From Europe : The entire South American continent once lived under European colonial rule, and the resultant political, social, and economic ties between former colonies and colonizers remain quite strong even today. Portuguese flag carrier TAP Airlines is by far the leading foreign carrier to Brazil, serving a slew of destinations in North and East Brazil , including direct connections from Lisbon to Porto Alegre in South Brazil and to the Brazilian capital Brasilia which otherwise have few other internattional connections. Spanish flag carrier Iberia flies to most of the former Spanish colonies, although neither Bolivia nor Paraguay are served. KLM flies between Amsterdam and Suriname and Air France links Paris with French Guiana . Of course, such services are not exclusive - KLM also flies to Lima , TAP to Caracas , Air France to Rio de Janeiro and Lima , etc. Other leading European airlines such as British Airways, Lufthansa, Swiss Airlines, and Alitalia also serve key South American gateways from their respective hubs, while South American airlines also operate into several major European cities as well. From North America : Until very recently, it was virtually inconceivable to reach South America from anywhere other than Miami . Today, however, rapidly developing hubs at Atlanta , Dallas / Fort Worth , Fort Lauderdale , Houston , Mexico City , New York , Newark , Orlando , Toronto , and Washington -Dulles offer viable alternatives. Indeed, airlines such as Air Canada, United and Delta Airlines have successfully begun to challenge the virtual monopoly once enjoyed by American Airlines to several key markets. American discount carriers such as Spirit Airlines and JetBlue (Azul in Brazil) have recently fought hard for and won several route authorities to serve the likes of Colombia , Brazil and Peru , bringing low fares to these markets for the first time. Recently, US Airways started a daily non-stop service from Charlotte to Rio de Janeiro . Given the U.S. airlines\' cutbacks in service, frequency, and cities served over the years, consider high quality Latin American carriers such as Avianca (to Colombia with daily non-stop flights to Bogot\xc3\xa1, Medell\xc3\xadn , Cali and Cartagena), Copa Airlines (Panama\'s national airline to hits hub in Panam\xc3\xa1 City), LAN Airlines (Chilean carrier serving Chile direct and via several other countries), or TAM (to Brazil, including some non-stop flights to other brazilian cities besides [S\xc3\xa3o Paulo]] and Rio de Janeiro , like Belo Horizonte , Brasilia and Manaus ). [ edit ] By car Beware there are no roads connecting Panama with Colombia, hence it is not possible to drive from Central America. People overcome this problem shipping their cars from Colon (Atlantic side in Panama) to Cartagena or Barranquilla (Colombia), or from Panama City (Pacific side of the Panama canal) to Buenaventura (Colombia) or Guayaquil (Ecuador). The Pan-American Highway is a series of routes starting in Central America and running to the tip of South America (save for the aforementioned gap between Panama and Colombia). It\'s an interesting option for those with a good vehicle, plenty of spare parts, and a desire to explore the western edge of the continent. [ edit ] By train There are no railroads between Panama and Colombia. [ edit ] By boat Some cruise liners cover the towns in the lower Caribbean (Cartagena, Santa Marta, Margarita Island). Royal Caribbean [1] , Holland America [2] , Princess Cruises [3] . [ edit ] Get around [ edit ] Visas The Union of South American Nations gives visa-free access and a customs union between all countries in South America. [ edit ] By plane [ edit ] By train There are no cross-country train services in South America, and with the exception of Argentina and Chile , domestic networks are quite limited. There are a number of very scenic "tourist trains" though, including the 445-km Quito - Guayaquil route in Ecuador . [ edit ] By bus Buses are the main form of land transportation for much of the continent... for longer distances you\'re often better off flying. [ edit ] Talk Spanish is the official language in all countries except Brazil, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana, and is widely spoken even in the countries that are not historically Spanish speaking. Portuguese is the official language in Brazil , which comprises about half the population and land area of the continent. Anyway, Spanish and Portuguese are such close languages that fluency in any of these will allow you to travel within the entire continent. There are also many indigenous tribes living in South America who speak their own languages, and if you are really going off the beaten track, you might have to learn them too. In Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana, the official languages are English , Dutch and French respectively.

[ edit ][ add listing ] Buy [ edit ][ add listing ] Eat what you want [ edit ][ add listing ] Drink [ edit ][ add listing ] Sleep [ edit ] Stay safe Wearing or carrying items which may identify you as an affluent tourist can be a mistake. You shouldn\'t pack anything that you would be upset to lose. Leave expensive jewelry, watches and other items of value at home and only carry what you need. That goes for credit cards and other documents as well; if you have no need for them leave them behind in the hotel safe, only take what money you are likely to spend with you. [ edit ] Stay healthy Tap water in many countries is not drinkable, it\'s wise to purify your own or buy bottled water. Malaria and Yellow fever can be a risk as well on the continent, check with a travel clinic or your doctor before heading out to see if you\'ll be in a high-risk area.

S'Wikitravel:About - Wikitravel Help Wikitravel grow by contributing to an article! Learn how . Wikitravel:About From Wikitravel Jump to: navigation , search Wikitravel ( http://wikitravel.org ) is a project to create a free , complete, up-to-date and reliable world-wide travel guide . It is built in collaboration by Wikitravellers from around the globe. Wikitravel is built with the spirit of sharing knowledge that makes travel so enjoyable. Whenever travellers meet each other on the road, they swap info about the places they came from and ask questions about places they\'re going. We want to make it easy to share that knowledge and let others share it; our copyleft license means that the facts you know can spread far and wide. The project was begun in July of 2003 by the two founders, Evan and Maj . It was inspired by Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia, and by the needs of travellers for timely information that long book-publishing cycles can\'t seem to meet. In April 2006, Wikitravel was acquired by Internet Brands, Inc., an operator of consumer information Web sites. To create Wikitravel we use a tool (or a process, or a technology) called Wiki which lets any Internet reader create , update, edit , and illustrate any article on the Web site. We all share our pieces of knowledge, edit them, distill them, and assemble them into a pleasing and cohesive whole. The more people that use the Edit link, the better Wikitravel becomes. We\'ve achieved some milestones , but we still have a long way to go. If you\'re new to Wikitravel , feel free to plunge forward and help us ! The Wikitravel universe also includes Wikitravel Shared \xe2\x80\x94 Wikitravel\'s image repository and cross-language coordination site (bugs, feature requests, language versions, etc).

Wikitravel:Quick contribution guide From Wikitravel Jump to: navigation , search Contents How to? Avoid Moving forward See also Wikitravel is the first complete, up-to-date and reliable world-wide travel guide . It is built in collaboration by Wikitravellers from around the globe, and your contributions will be seen by 7 Million travelers every month! You can make a valuable contribution to Wikitravel in just minutes. For information on how your contributions are licensed, read copyleft . How to? Add Listing Feature Add Listing Box 1. Add a listing . Articles on Wikitravel have different Sections: See , Do , Buy , Eat , Drink , Sleep . Right next to each section there is an option to Add Listing. Simply click on it and "Add New Listing" box will show up. Fill out the sections following our guidelines and click on Save . In this way you have contributed to Wikitravel and helped other Travelers! What to add . Choose any attraction, park, view, bar, pub or restaurant that you are enthusiastic about and would like to share information about. It should be somewhere you know and have visited, but it really doesn\'t matter if you have been there while travelling, or if it is in your local area. You don\'t have to be an expert. Your experience and perspective is valuable to others like you. How to describe it . Decide what type of person would like to visit, and what are the features that would make them want to visit. Everybody has different interests, from birdwatching to adventure sports, from quiet country pub to the latest urban beats. Help travellers find what they like. If you like it, what are your interests that make you like it? If you know the best way to get there, or the best time to experience it, add that too. Don\'t use I , me ,, us , or we in the description. Don\'t hesitate to use you , though, when addressing the reader. Edit a page 2. Edit a page . You can edit any article on Wikitravel simply by clicking "Edit" link. You will see the text formatted in Wiki markup . It helps the rest of us if you follow our policies and guidelines and manual of style . However, even more important than following every guideline is to plunge forward and write something \xe2\x80\x93 someone will be along to help with the formatting later! Add your hometown, or a place you\xe2\x80\x99ve visited often! Find the right article . Wikitravel articles are named after the geographical location. Select the best article based on where the attraction is. If it is outside of a town, you might have to place it where travellers would normally stay when visiting it. Find the right section . See for sights. Do for activities. Drink for nightlife, pubs and bars, Eat for restaurants, cafes, and fast food. More in Where you can stick it and standard article sections guide . How to describe it . Decide what type of person would like to visit, and what are the features that would make them want to visit. Everybody has different interests, from birdwatching to adventure sports, from quiet country pub to the latest urban beats. Help travellers find what they like. If you like it, what are your interests that make you like it? If you know the best way to get there, or the best time to experience it, add that too. Don\'t use I , me ,, us , or we in the description. Don\'t hesitate to use you , though, when addressing the reader. 3. Create a page . sometimes the destination you would like to describe or add an attraction to doesn\'t exist. Plunge forward and start an article. Check that the page you want does not already exist, or that the information doesn\'t already exist on another page. Do a search for the name of your proposed new page, and see what is returned. When creating a new page, you will be asked to choose the right template. New pages can be created for cities, towns, national parks, and regions ; for travel topics (including phrasebooks ); and for itineraries . Please do not create new articles for hotels, restaurants or attractions; they should be listed in existing destination articles instead. See What is an article? for details. 4. Register an Account . Anybody can make contributions to Wikitravel, but creating an account will give you various benefits : Write on User Talk pages to communicate with other writers about your edits and travel tips. Ability to turn off advertising in your Account Settings. Credit for your travel writing/edits, which will be attributed to you rather than just an IP address. Your contributions will be more trusted as you become familiar to other Wikitravelers. Avoid Changing section headings - even if you don\'t like them. Wikitravel uses a standard template for each article. Writing about culture . Wikitravel articles often have Respect or Understand sections, which attract extensive contributions on culture. However, your time is best spent adding practical advice and suggestions, and letting the traveller discover the culture for themselves when they get there. Writing about things you don\'t like . Don\'t waste your time on Wikitravel telling travellers about places they don\'t want to go, sharing your insight into somewhere travellers would want to go is infinitely more valuable! Encyclopaedic or promotional language . Writing that something is fantastic or the best can be meaningless to a reader who may have different interests to you. Remember to think of why you like something, and say it in the normal words you would use. Don\'t adopt the tone of a tourism board, or a neutral point of view just because you are writing in a guide. Your natural conversational tone, and your genuine interest in what you are describing is what we are hoping to capture! Moving forward If you want to get more involved, or learn more about Wikitravel you could start by reading the manual of style , and the help files which will give you an in-depth description, or by looking at some of our star articles .

Blocked Wikitravel upgrade - read-only mode for a few days beginning Monday, 25 March 2013 The Travellers\' pub is the place to ask questions when you\'re confused, lost, afraid, tired, annoyed, thoughtful, or helpful. Please check the FAQ and Help page before asking a question, though, since that may save your time and others\'. Please add new questions at the bottom of the page and sign your post by appending four tildes (~~~~) to it, but otherwise plunge forward ! If you have a question or suggestion about a particular article, try using talk pages to keep the discussion specific to that article. If you are having a problem that you think has to do with the Mediawiki software , please post that on the Technical requests page on Wikitravel Shared instead. If you want to celebrate a significant contribution to Wikitravel by yourself or others, Wikitravel:Celebrate a contribution may be the place you are looking for. Please sweep the pub Keeping the Pub clean is a group effort. If we have too many conversations on this page, it will get too noisy and hard to read. If you see an old conversation (ie dormant for a month or more) that could or should be moved to another page, please do so, and note there that it has been swept in from the pub. A question regarding a destination article should be swept to the article discussion page A discussion regarding a policy or the subject of an expedition can be swept to the policy or expedition discussion page A simple question asked by a user can be swept to that user\'s talk page, but consider if the documentation needs a quick update to make it clearer for the next user with the same question. A pointer to a discussion going on elsewhere, such as a notice of a star nomination or or a request to comment on another talk page, can be removed when it is two months old. Any discussion that occurred in the pub can be swept to to where the main discussion took place. Any discussions that do not fall into any of these categories, and are not of any special importance for posterity, should be archived to Wikitravel:Travellers\' pub/Archives and removed from here. If you are not sure where to put a discussion, leave it alone \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s better to spend your efforts on those that you do know where to place. [ edit ] New administrators nomination We have a new nomination for the administrator on Wikitravel. Please have a look at Administrator nominations . Best, IBAlex 20:34, 3 December 2012 (EST) [ edit ] Improvement Ideas We are planning to revitalize Wikitravel and our community! In 2013 we would like to improve technicality and usability of the site and we are open to any ideas! Please let us know of any new features you would like to have on WT and share with us your suggestions on how to make Wikitravel better. Thank you! IBAlex 14:20, 20 December 2012 (EST) Please list the appropriate pages to make suggestions. -- 118.93.73.30 03:16, 2 January 2013 (EST) Please enable the API. I would love to use Wikitravel with my iPad App (Wikipanion) 217.160.127.250 06:24, 14 January 2013 (EST) Please would you list the appropriate pages to make suggestions! (I assume it can\'t be here, because few are replying here...) -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 23:20, 18 March 2013 (EDT) IBAlex : Please would you clarify ( on this actual Pub page and preferably in this topic and IN PLAIN TEXT - many people don\'t read edit summaries ) WHERE folks should make suggestions? I know this is going to come across as very snippy - but I really think it important that IBadmins should read this page at least at the beginning and end of their working shift and leave some sort of reply - even if it\'s only a holding reply (so as not to create a bad impression). If you read down, you will see that many topics are still waiting an authoritative reply, and if you are sincere about wanting to "revitalize Wikitravel and our community" this task is probably at least as important as welcoming robot spammers and then deleting their accounts... -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 18:40, 22 March 2013 (EDT) [ edit ] Policy on free-riding tips I got some second thoughts about deleting tips on how to evade a station entrance fee in Stockholm-Arlanda Airport: Link to change log What is Wikitravel\'s policy for riding transports, or entering venues, without a proper ticket? Is it a no-no, or are there circumstances when such information is allowed? / Blist 19:12, 23 December 2012 (EST) There is an Wikitravel:Illegal_activities_policy . AlasdairW 19:14, 26 December 2012 (EST) Based on the above policy I\'d say it\'s clear that info should be deleted. It could be argued as acceptable e.g. if there\'s an official requirement to pay for a ticket but everybody ignores it and it isn\'t controlled or sanctioned - falling somewhat loosely under "Where police or public corruption mean that the written law of the land differs substantially from the practise of law enforcement." Maaaybe applicable in this case if all local U-30 people do it. Berserk 23:36, 26 December 2012 (EST) Related is G\xc3\xa4vle , where I saw the need to point out that burning the G\xc3\xa4vle Goat is illegal, since the goats have been burnt down by foreign travellers, who were deceived by locals to commit the act, with legal consequences. / Blist 15:50, 27 December 2012 (EST) [ edit ] Star Articles Many articles on Wikitravel are very well developed and serve as a great source of information for many Travelers. We should nominate the best ones as Star Articles and feature them on the Main Page. I nominated Bangkok today. Please let me know what you think and if you have any other candidates. IBAlex 15:23, 14 January 2013 (EST) [ edit ] New Main Page We have updated today the Main Page and added a fully new section with Top Destinations . Right now we are featuring Top Destinations 2013 and Top Ski Destination . We would like to change this section frequently and we are open to your ideas for future top places around the world, for example: Top Beaches Top Hiking Places What are your ideas? Please let us know . Thank you! IBAlex 13:10, 18 January 2013 (EST) [ edit ] moon Interestingly, we have the option to book hotels for the moon with the orbitz booking tool. 19:12, 11 February 2013 (EST) Hi! Thanks for notifying us! I\'m afraid this option will have to be disabled soon\xc2\xa0:) Cheers! IBAlex 19:21, 11 February 2013 (EST) [ edit ] Default image sizes in Thumbnails Currently, all unregistered users (and those logged-on, registered users that have not bothered to change their preferences at My Preferences > Appearance > Thumbnail size from the default) view thumbnails at the (relatively small) default width of 180px Since this default was set 10 years ago, connection speeds have typically increased (and prices reduced) worldwide. I would, therefore, like to suggest that the default size be modestly increased to 250px and the pick selection be changed from: $wgThumbLimits = array( 120, 150, 180, 200, 250, 300 ); to: $wgThumbLimits = array( 120, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500 ); The relevant variable in LocalSettings.php on the server in which to set this range of thumbnail size options is, I think, $wgThumbLimits . (And see also in the Manual\'s FAQ, How do I change default user preferences and $wgDefaultUserOptions ].) Does anyone disagree and, if so, why? -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 01:10, 15 March 2013 (EDT) 19:10, 28 February 2013 (EST) Grrrrrrreat - it seems everyone is either asleep or in full agreement with the above proposal. IBadmins: please would you indicate how long it will take to make this change? -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 19:18, 13 March 2013 (EDT) Currently we are working on upgrading the website and we are using fully our IT resources. The upgrade is the priority. Once we accomplish that I can assure you that we will resolve the issue with "Default image sizes in Thumbnails". Thank you for your understanding! Warm regards, IBAlex 21:08, 13 March 2013 (EDT) That\'s terrific news! Can you indicate what sort of "upgrading" we can expect - or is it all top secret? I\'ll ask you again in a couple of weeks if you\'re not able to give an indication now. Thanks! -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 11:20, 13 March 2013 (EDT) [ edit ] Template:Panorama now seems to work - but use it sparingly until we sort out the image defaults above. (There may be a case for having just a tiny thumbnail on the main article pages with a link to a subpage of the main article containing any panorama images to save hassles for roaming mobile users and those on other slow/expensive connections)... -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 19:21, 7 March 2013 (EST) What image defaults would you suggest? I checked Milford Sound page and the image is too wide. Would love to fix it together with you. Cheers! IBAlex 20:07, 8 March 2013 (EST) I\'ve suggested them in the section immediately above this one. When you say "too wide", what do you mean exactly, please? Do you mean that there is no slider visible below the image window or that the image window does not size itself according to the page width or that the image window overflows the left or right hand gutters? If any of these, could you specify your operating system and browser versions and whether you have right hand advertising switched on or off in your user preferences, please? -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 22:13, 8 March 2013 (EST) Thanks for replying. I meant that the image window does not size itself according to the page width. I tried to edit the Milford Sound page and when I changed the parameters to 900px, it looked better. I understood that above you were suggesting the default image sizes in thumbnails, not panoramic images, is that right? I am using Windows 7, Mozilla Firefox and I have the ads turned on. Thank you! Warm regards, IBAlex 14:15, 11 March 2013 (EDT) How bizarre! Can you upload screenshots, please? What happens with Chrome or IE Explorer? Yes, the sub-section above is not concerned with Panorama images. However, I may have to stop trying to improve the look and feel of your pages if the spam filters keep obstructing me. It is very important that a look and feel is developed which is attractive and easy to read for unregistered users and that also allows you to keep your current width of adverts (that you depend on for monetising this site) so that your technical support and development can be financed. -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 19:00, 11 March 2013 (EDT) BUMP : I know there have been some great changes in your life recently, User:IBalex , but please can you favour me with a response to my queries above so I can move on with re-coding if necessary? -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 19:20, 13 March 2013 (EDT) That\'s how the page displays on my screen I have uploaded the picture to show you how the panorama picture displays on my computer. Right now I have to scroll to the right. Yes, I got the same results on the other browsers. I opt that we keep the panorama pic parameters in a way that it sizes itself according to the page width. If you experience problems with Abuse Filters, please let me know. Thanks! IBAlex 21:04, 13 March 2013 (EDT) Screenshot of English Wikitravel\'s Milford Sound page showing the slider of the new Panorama templated view box on a narrow screen (note the usual "enlarge" widget at the lower right hand corner and the fact that the caption text has wrapped to a second line) Unfortunately you have not taken a screenshot of your whole screen (and, more especially, your screen width ), but I have a strong suspicion that you are using a relatively wide screen (or at least one wide enough to display the whole width of the wide panorama and, therefore, you have no slider to pan left or right. What happens when you reduce the width of your tab or window and do you have an "enlarge" widget visible at the bottom right? Screenshot of same section of our Milford Sound page showing how the whole view box (when using the new Panorama template) expands to fit the whole width of the page on a wider screen (note the usual "enlarge" widget at the lower right hand corner) I am enclosing two screen-grabs of how things look on typical laptops or notebooks (as opposed to wide, desk-top monitors). Please try reducing your tab/window width to a narrow width and report here what happens. If you continue to have further problems, I will need full details such as screen size in pixels, and all your preference settings including what skin you are using and whether you have adverts and Orbitz switched on or off... -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 04:09, 14 March 2013 (EDT) [ edit ] Emergency phone numbers I have made a start on adding the unified emergency phone number to the quickbar of about a dozen English speaking countries that have a unified common number but there are still a couple of hundred to go... -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 04:59, 12 March 2013 (EDT) For those who are interested in helping, this is an example of the type of edit that needs to be made (obviously the actual number or numbers will change between countries! -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 17:49, 22 March 2013 (EDT) [ edit ] Linking to Encyclopaedia Britannica articles Because we want to develop our own travel related content here (and also because travellers may be reading a printed version or off-line), we do not link to secondary sources here on the web\'s most read travel guide. However, we are not (and will never be) an encyclopaedia. We have a different aim and focus and a different tone . Our ability to use primary sources is one of the great strengths of our travel guide - nothing in Wikipedia is going to beat our ability to utilise the insights of people who have visited a destination recently - the conundrum comes in distinguishing which anecdotes we can rely on from those that are self-serving or mendacious and unfair . I think we should consider giving our readers free access to any of Britannica\'s 120,000 articles directly from this web site with special types of in-line links. IBadmins : You might want to ask your IT department to engineer special types of visually distinctive links brief instructions here , or we can just slightly change our policies so that when our readers click through the special type of in-line link to Britannica from our articles, he or she will be able to view the complete article\xe2\x80\x94even those that normally require a subscription to read\xe2\x80\x94as a free sample. For example, to link to the Britannica Online article on Horatio Nelson, Viscount Nelson from our own Nelson (New Zealand) article, the Britannica article URL is http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/408359/Horatio-Nelson-Viscount-Nelson Our HTML code then might look something like <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href=" http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/408359/Horatio-Nelson-Viscount-Nelson ">Viscount Horatio Nelson<img src=" http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/71/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica.svg " border="0" width="14" hspace="3" vspace="2" /></a> and display a little like: Viscount Horatio Nelson (I\'ve prepared a normal xl here without the logo in a version of our Nelson (New Zealand) article). Note: This code will link users to the article on the publicly accessible Britannica site britannica.com . Readers that they recognize as members of a college or library that subscribes to Britannica will have the same experience as a paid subscriber to the public site with full access to the entire site in an advertising-free environment. Readers that are not members of a subscribing institution will still be able to access the full article, however additional content may be restricted and users may be served advertising. Please note that, for readers that do not have access via a subscription, that the link will be to the full Britannica article only when the page holding the link is hosted on a Web Server. When you test this page on your local machine, it will still lead to the truncated version of the article. This is not an error, and when the same page is put on a Web Server it will still work as intended. -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 17:10, 16 March 2013 (EDT) [ edit ] Renovating our Listing format One of the great things about this travel guide is how easy we have made it for casual editors to both wt:add a listing and then update it as information like opening hours or prices change. However, currently businesses have a perverse double incentive not to use these great XML style listings, since that way they get to retain an obviously Clickable blue name and arrow symbol 3 Example St, \xe2\x98\x8e +65 1234 5678 and avoid that (baffling) Non-clickable black name in bold without arrow symbol , 3 Example St , \xe2\x98\x8e +65 1234 5678 , [1] . But with footnote style, meaninglessly incrementing number doohickey right at the end \xc2\xa0 edit . Please could the IT department make it a top priority to change this style so that the name="?" tag field becomes BLUE anchor text with the clickable arrow symbol directly after it in an identical way to the non-XML style listings? Please also remind them to implement HTML code similar to <a target="_blank" href="http://example-motel.com">Example Motel</a> in both styles so as to make the hyperlink open in a new window/tab so that a return to our great travel site is as easy and fast as just closing the spawned window or tab. At the same time, they could activate the geographical co-ordinate information. -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 02:00, 17 March 2013 (EDT) [ edit ] Joke article for 2013 Hello! April Fool\'s 2013 is coming up! Let\'s choose this year\'s joke article . Any suggestions?:) You can leave your comment here IBAlex 20:03, 14 March 2013 (EDT) [ edit ] Bot? Is User:Tyen a bot\xc2\xa0? He/she/it never replies and seems to be able ( Special:Contributions/Tyen ) to make 12 boilerplate welcoming edits to 12 separate user pages inside 60 seconds! Don\'t we have a policy that bots should be named and "owned" by a human being? Why can\'t I find any mention of this (eg: at Wikitravel:Bots )\xc2\xa0? -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 19:29, 18 March 2013 (EDT) These are two genuine questions that I would really like simple answers for; presumably Yes and/or No. It would also be nice to receive responses to the earlier issues. -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 14:51, 21 March 2013 (EDT) User:Tyen is not a bot. Cheers! IBAlex 15:10, 21 March 2013 (EDT) [ edit ] Blocked I appear to have been accidentally blocked and can only edit by logging out. Can anyone help? I have edits I need to make to my user page. User:LtPowers Also, my user page is protected, so I can\'t edit it. It still states that I\'m an administrator. LtPowers 15:26, 22 March 2013 (EDT) I\'m sorry to hear about these difficulties. I can\'t think of a better place to publicly leave a message like this. However, you might try leaving a message on their user talk pages to either User:IBobi or User:IBAlex or both; I know they are both active IBadmins here, just in case it\'s slipped their attention. Have you notified your resignation at Wikitravel:Administrator nominations \xc2\xa0? (Later) Good news! I see that your are no longer listed as an administrator here: http://wikitravel.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Special:ListUsers&group=sysop and User:IBobi seems to have already made the necessary adjustment to your user page . Is your complaint that you can not edit your User talk page? I assume that you are able to edit in other namespaces (since you seem to able to edit in the "Wikitravel" and main article namespaces)? -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 16:38, 22 March 2013 (EDT) Ugh, I forgot what it was I wanted to change! No, actually, I wanted to remove the Docent information on my user page, but with it protected I cannot. I did not resign my adminship, it was removed. Contrary to policy, I believe, but I never did get an answer on that one. LtPowers 16:53, 22 March 2013 (EDT) Mmmm, looking briefly at some edit histories, I have a strong suspicion that this is something you will need to take up directly with User:IBobi who was the original blocking/protecting IBadmin. For what it\'s worth, I do agree that it is not appropriate for you to be listed as a Docent when you are unwilling to undertake that job. Looking on the bright side, I see from your User talk page that you have not been troubled with too many requests that you have needed to decline recently. Since it seems the original problem is now obsolete (and the continuing problem with not being able to edit your own User page is probably better resolved directly with User:IBobi ) would you have any objection to my now archiving this topic as having been dealt with? -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 17:09, 22 March 2013 (EDT) Great news! User:IBAlex is on the job and has now edited your user page appropriately . -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 17:12, 22 March 2013 (EDT) [ edit ] Wikitravel upgrade - read-only mode for a few days beginning Monday, 25 March 2013 Hello all, We\'re excited to announce that Wikitravel will be upgrading its software next week. In order to migrate Wikitravel\'s extraordinary database of travel information, we\'ll be putting the site into read-only mode starting Monday 3/25/2013 and running for about three days. No edits will be possible at this time. When we come back, we\'ll be better than ever. Please let us know if there are any questions or concerns, -- IBobi 17:36, 22 March 2013 (EDT) Fantastic news! Will you be able to attend to some of the topics that need an answer further up this Pub page, or will they have to wait a while longer, please? -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 17:41, 22 March 2013 (EDT) Hi, I would like to know which local time you based on. Monday 3/25/2013 of UTC? Or EST or PST? Also, I want to know the approximate starting time. Since I want to notice ja: wikitravelers the correct information as well as possible, your corporation is very much appreciated.-- Shoestring 21:47, 22 March 2013 (EDT) An excellent point, Shoestring ! Perhaps the upgrade would be a suitable time to change the signature timestamps from the historical and East Coast of the US-centric EDT and EST over to UTC so that they match those in the edit summaries , histories, and everywhere else? After all most of the world is probably a bit confused by the East Coast\'s Summer times, and UTC (or "Zulu" time) is what the US military and scientific community use. (Please note that I have manually edited my timestamp to this message so that it is UTC (known by many Americans as Greenwich Mean Time or GMT) -- 118 dot93dot73dot30 02:25, 23 March 2013 (UTC) Dear Wikitravelers! The upgrade is planned to start Monday morning PST. Thank you for your cooperation!

Wikitravel:Ways to help Wikitravel From Wikitravel Jump to: navigation , search There are as many ways to help Wikitravel as there are Wikitravellers . This article is for those who like the idea of Wikitravel, but are having a hard time getting started with contributing. Update the article for the town/region you live in. Navigate to the article for your home town, either by going through the directory on the Main Page or using the search functionality. Take a good look to see that it\'s correct, if the article is there. Make sure that major attractions are listed. Would you recommend a restaurant or a pub that is currently missing? See if you can fill in any details (hours, prices, phone numbers) for any of the entries there. If there\'s not an article on your home town, start one ! Please, repeat this exercise for your home state or province, region, country, or whatever. Find articles to help with. There are many ways to do this. Special:Newpages gives you all the pages that have been created recently. Check that new pages are suitable for articles . Special:Recentchanges gives you the pages that have been edited recently. Watch recent changes for vandalism and inappropriate editing. Orphaned pages gives you articles that do not have links pointing to them. Unless you do something about them, they are most likely to be forgotten about, because contributors will ordinarily never come across them or improve them. Dead-end pages are those which do not link to any other. Sometimes this is okay, but often this indicates that the page has been created by a new user who is not yet familiar with inserting wikilinks. Special:Randompage , as the name suggests, will throw up a random page. Usually, you can find something to improve in any page. Proofread . This is one of the easiest ways to get started with helping with Wikitravel. While you\'re reading an article, watch for spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, or other writing gaffes. If you see one, edit the page and correct it. Wikitravel is now that much better -- thanks to you! Reformat articles . Wikitravel has a manual of style for giving a consistent look-and-feel to our content and making it easier for travellers to find and use information. Just as with proofreading, you can do a lot of good just by reformatting or restructuring articles to match the Manual. Articles that need reformatting are typically stub articles , which usually lack standard headings and outlines. See also any articles in Category:Articles needing attention . The dead end pages , which list articles without any links on them, are also worth a look, as are the various Wikitravel:Syntax checks . Organize the Geographical hierarchy . Work to help organise regions and to make make it easier to navigate the site. Rate articles . Wikitravel has a system to indicate the maturity status of articles. This helps keep track of what stage an article is in and how many articles are at what level of maturity. Expand listings. It can help a lot to take short restaurant listings , attraction listings , or other listings and fill them out. Contributors will often leave out crucial information about an attraction, such as its address, phone number, hours, or price. Often, this information can be found on the World Wide Web. Check for articles for places you\'ve visited. As with your home town, find articles for places you\'ve visited. Check them for accuracy, add information, or start them new. Don\'t limit yourself to things you already know. You don\'t have to have firsthand knowledge of a destination or topic to contribute to the article! Find articles that need work and do some research -- on Wikipedia , on the Web, or with other reference media -- to get started on working on that article. Make outlines. Don\'t be daunted by the task of writing all of the article about Russia -- just get it started with an outline . People are much more likely to change or add to articles than to start them from scratch. We have a bunch of handy templates for destination guides, which you can use. If you only know a teensy bit about a subject, go ahead and add it in. We currently have a huge backlog of stub articles that shouldn\'t really be there. It is easy to create an outline for most articles and move them to the next level. You can help there. Respond to requests. Sometimes people put up requests in the Wikitravel:Help wanted area for articles, images, or work to be done on articles. Keep an eye on these pages: Requests for images . Watch for wanted articles. The Special:Wantedpages feature of our software lets you see which articles have been linked to but not yet written. These are excellent places to get started -- you\'re filling in what is an obvious need for the travel guide. Follow red links. While you\'re reading articles, if you see a link for an article that\'s Not There Yet, follow the link and add in some information. We\'re nowhere near close to covering all the info we need to have -- when you start a new page , we\'re that much closer. Take Wikitravel with you. Before you go on a trip, try to find articles in Wikitravel about the destinations you\'re visiting. Print them out -- or download them to your PDA, or whatever -- and take them with you on your trip. Keep notes on what\'s right, what\'s wrong, and what\'s missing. If the destination you\'re going to isn\'t in Wikitravel yet, take notes for a new article to start when you get back. Join an Expedition . There are several tasks for making a real travel guide that require special skills and talents. We\'ve created special subprojects called Expeditions to organize the efforts of people who have these talents. Do you know a foreign (non-English) language? Help out with the Phrasebook Expedition . Can you draw? Try your hand at the Mapmaking Expedition . Promote Wikitravel. The more people who read and contribute to Wikitravel, the better it becomes, and the closer we get to our goal of making a free, complete, up-to-date and reliable world-wide travel guide. There are a number of ways to promote Wikitravel ; check to see if you can do one or more of them. Help new contributors. New users contributing to Wikitravel can have a lot of questions and problems. Your experience with Wikitravel can make their learning curve a lot easier. Watch for questions in the travellers\' pub or on talk pages and respond helpfully. If you see the same question over and over, add it to the FAQ . You can even add to the Help index for more complicated questions or issues. If there are help topics already in place that people seem not to see or understand, maybe you can help get that information out by reorganizing the help area. Cheerlead. Nothing makes people feel better than knowing their work is appreciated. When you see a good piece of writing, or a great picture, or whatever, let the Wikitraveller who made it know that you liked it. Just a bit of encouragement on the article\'s talk page , or on the user\'s user talk page , can make a world of difference. Shape the community. Our project is still young, and much of the way we\'ve decided to work together is still untested. If you have ideas for how to work together better, please suggest them as new policies and guidelines . It doesn\'t matter how long you\'ve been a Wikitraveller: you just might have an idea that will make things work smoother. At worst, you\'ll make explicit some policy that\'s currently implicit; that\'s a good thing. If there are policies already in place that people aren\'t following, maybe you can help get that information out by reorganizing the policies area. Welcome new users. When new users come onto Wikitravel, it\'s nice to leave them a brief welcome message pointing them to important parts of the site. We normally wait until folks have created a user account and possibly set up their own user page . Welcome messages let new contributors know that they\'re part of a community, and also make sure they have pointers to important tools for contributing. Clean up the travellers\' pub. The travellers\' pub , as the default place to put discussions about Wikitravel, tends to get a little crowded at times. For this reason people take turns moving discussions out of the pub and into the archives or to more specific talk pages. It only takes a few minutes, it helps make discussions more clear, and it\'s easy to do. Make or edit policy and style guidelines. The policies and manual of style define how we work together to make a great travel guide. If you\'re working on Wikitravel and think there\'s ways we can make a better guide, or we can work together better to achieve our goals , by all means start a new policy or guideline page! We try to make decisions by consensus , so there\'s no guarantee that your idea will be accepted, but it definitely won\'t be if you don\'t suggest it in the first place! Work on MediaWiki . The software we use for Wikitravel is called MediaWiki . If you know the PHP programming language, contributing to MediaWiki really helps Wikitravel. Fixing bugs or adding features makes it easier for other Wikitravellers to add great content.

S'Wikitravel:Welcome, newcomers - Wikitravel Help Wikitravel grow by contributing to an article! Learn how . Wikitravel:Welcome, newcomers From Wikitravel Jump to: navigation , search Contents Finding travel information Share your knowledge More information See also Welcome to Wikitravel ! We, the Wikitravellers who\'ve made it, hope that you enjoy what you see and that you join us in making a free , up-to-date, complete and reliable world-wide travel guide. [ edit ] Finding travel information Travel guides on Wikitravel are mostly arranged geographically. You generally won\'t find articles on attractions, hotels and restaurants, but you hopefully will find all that information and more in our destination guide articles for countries, cities, and towns. You can try searching for the destination you are interested in. You may be taken immediately to a guide for that destination, or if there isn\'t a guide on that destination, you will see a list of articles that mention it. You can also try searching for the name of a attraction you are looking for, and the search will return a list of relevant articles. Alternatively, you can browse through our geographical hierarchy. You can start at the continents and regions listed on our Main Page , and work your way down through the region, city and district links to the area you are interested in. After you have found the guide for the area you are interested in, there may still be more information waiting for you to read. We don\'t cover information on how to get into a country in every destination guide. You won\'t find visa information for Australia in the Sydney article. So, if you are coming from further afield, you may want to refer to the breadcrumb links at the top of the page, and read the country or region guide, to make sure you have the full picture. We don\'t list general travel information in every guide. We have helpful articles on things like money , visas , how to stay safe and how to deal with language barriers in our list of travel topics . Remember that Wikitravel is an open guide that anyone can edit. Often that means you can get up to the minute information and inside information on attractions and the latest buzz, but sometimes it means that some information can be unverified and unreliable. As with any other guide, you should double check and confirm any information that is critical to the success of your travels. If you have particular travel questions that aren\'t covered in a guide, you can ask a docent . A docent is a volunteer guide, and if there is one for your area there will be a link in the sidebar on the left containing their contact information. For general questions, post a message in our Travellers\' pub . You\'re free to use the articles in Wikitravel in almost any way, thanks to our copyleft license. [ edit ] Share your knowledge This is a reader-created Web site; all the information you see in Wikitravel was contributed by Internet users just like you. We\'re trying to create, illustrate, and edit a travel guide for the entire world , and we need your help . It\'s a humongous job. As they say, though, "Many hands make light work;" anything you can do to contribute is appreciated. You don\'t have to be an "expert" in travel; you just have to be interested enough to get started. You\'re always welcome to plunge forward and make changes to any page on the site (including this one). Just click the Edit this page link, and you\'ll get a Web form that lets you change the contents of the page. Hit Save page , and your version is what\'s shown on the site. (If you\'re nervous, feel free to practice on the graffiti wall ). If you find yourself getting more involved, you may want to read our tips for new contributors . Our list of goals and non-goals give a good idea of what we\'re trying to do with Wikitravel. If you\'ve got some specific info you want to share, we have some guidelines on where you can stick it (pun intended). You can also read our manual of style for more clues as to how to edit and layout guides, but don\'t worry too much about that stuff if you don\'t want. Don\'t forget to describe yourself on your user page to help other contributors to communicate with you (and even to ask for your help sometimes). There are other ways to help Wikitravel , too. We have a lot of stuff that needs to be done. And if you have special skills or interests, consider joining a related Expedition . [ edit ] More information We have quite a bit of help documentation to make reading and editing Wikitravel as easy as we can. If you have any questions about Wikitravel, please read our FAQ first to see if it\'s already answered. If not, feel free to ask your question in the travellers\' pub , where friendly Wikitravellers will help guide your way. We can\'t say how important it is to us that you are reading and contributing on Wikitravel. If you need anything , just ask us (however you can). We want you to enjoy Wikitravel, to find the info you need, and (we hope) to be inspired to share your knowledge with others.

S'Wikitravel:What is a docent? - Wikitravel Help Wikitravel grow by contributing to an article! Learn how . Wikitravel:What is a docent? From Wikitravel Jump to: navigation , search Contents What is a docent? How can I contact a docent? What can a docent do for me? Which locations have docents? What can I do if my destination has no docent? See also Greetings, traveller! If you\'re reading this, you\'ve probably clicked on a link on one of our travel guides, wondering "What is a docent?", "How can I contact a docent?", or "What can a docent do for me?" Here are your answers. [ edit ] What is a docent? The dictionary says a docent (say DOUGH-sent) is "a trained volunteer museum guide. A docent is at once a volunteer, a teacher, and a guide." Well we\'re not a museum, but that\'s still a pretty good description of what docents do here on Wikitravel. Docents are volunteers\xe2\x80\x94fellow users of this site\xe2\x80\x94who know a lot about a particular destination. They\'ve volunteered their time and knowledge to help travellers like you who have questions. [ edit ] How can I contact a docent? If a destination has a docent who has volunteered to help, you will see his or her username on the left side of your screen, underneath the search box. If you don\'t see the "Destination Docents" box, then that destination has no docent. If you do see a docent listed, you can click on his or her username and you\'ll be taken to the docent\'s User Page. There, the docent should have a clearly-labeled section that lists the destinations he or she is familiar with and explains his or her preferred contact method. Usually, you can contact a docent by leaving a message on his or her User Talk Page, but some docents may prefer e-mail, or another contact method. You should also be aware that some docents have become inactive and don\'t check their talk pages as often, or at all. If you don\'t get a response, don\'t take it personally; sometimes people move on to other things. However you contact your docent, remember to always be courteous and patient. Docents are volunteers and can be very busy in what we call "real life"\xe2\x80\x94working, taking care of children, etc. Plan ahead so that the docent has plenty of time to get back to you before your trip. [ edit ] What can a docent do for me? We\'re trying to write travel guides that cover just about any question you might have, but it\'s a long, slow process. If you have a question\xe2\x80\x94any question at all\xe2\x80\x94about a destination, you can ask a docent. They can tell you the best way to get to an attraction, the best place to get local cuisine, or which areas of a city you should avoid. Docents are not for hire. They may not even live anywhere near your destination. They won\'t meet you in person and take you on tours. They\'re only here to provide you with information and guidance. Keep your expectations in line. [ edit ] Which locations have docents? We have an alphabetical list of destinations with docents, though there\'s no guarantee that a particular docent is still active. [ edit ] What can I do if my destination has no docent? You can try asking a question on the article\'s Talk Page (click on the "discussion" tab at the top of the page); people who have edited the article might see your question and be able to answer it, or tell you where to find an answer. If you can\'t get your question answered, take heart. Go ahead and plunge forward and travel to your destination. Find out the answer to your question there. When your trip is over, you can bring that answer back and write it into the destination\'s article . It\'s as easy as clicking the "edit" button at the top of the page, and then you\'ll be a Wikitraveller too!

Kaikki heist\xc3\xa4 eiv\xc3\xa4t asu Suomessa (tarkalleen ottaen kaikki eiv\xc3\xa4t edes ymm\xc3\xa4rr\xc3\xa4 suomea!), mutta ovat kuitenkin mukana suomenkielisen Wikitravelin kirjoittamisessa, kuvittamisessa tai yll\xc3\xa4pit\xc3\xa4misess\xc3\xa4. Wikimatkaajat eiv\xc3\xa4t ole mik\xc3\xa4\xc3\xa4n tarkkaan rajattu homogeeninen joukko, mutta voidaan varmaankin sanoa, ett\xc3\xa4 wikimatkaajat noin yleisesti ovat kiinnostuneet matkailusta ja avoimesta tiedon jakamisesta. Wikimatkaajat eiv\xc3\xa4t muodosta mit\xc3\xa4\xc3\xa4n salaseuraa tai sis\xc3\xa4piiri\xc3\xa4, vaan ovat ihan tavallisia ihmisi\xc3\xa4 kuten sin\xc3\xa4kin. Jokin vet\xc3\xa4\xc3\xa4 meit\xc3\xa4 tien p\xc3\xa4\xc3\xa4lle, l\xc3\xa4helle tai kauas, ja haluamme jakaa tietoamme ja kokemuksiamme muiden matkaajien avuksi.

Ja tekemist\xc3\xa4 riitt\xc3\xa4\xc3\xa4 - jokainen askel eteenp\xc3\xa4in vie meid\xc3\xa4t kohti tavoitettamme: luotettavaa, kattavaa, ilmaista ja vapaata maailmanlaajuista matkaopasta.

What do I need to do to get uploading images? How will I be attributed? Can GFDL content be used on Wikitravel? Can I copy text and other content to Wikitravel from other sites? If content is available free-of-charge, can it be used here? How should I ask for permission to use a forum reply on Wikitravel? See also The Universal License of Our Wiki Wikitravel uses a copyleft license for all text, images, and other content on the Web site. Anyone can use Wikitravel content according to the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license. And anyone can contribute their own or other people\'s text and images, as long as the work is their own or available under a compatible license. It is very important that you understand how copyleft works before you contribute to Wikitravel . If you find your work reused by someone else in a manner that you didn\'t consider, or if you stop using Wikitravel for any reason, it is not possible to change the license for the text and photographs you have already submitted. Although you always own the copyright in your work, that does not give you the right to change how it can be used retrospectively. [ edit ] Licensing If this seems confusing, skip down to the FAQ . All written contributions to Wikitravel are and must be licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 ( CC-by-SA 3.0 ) or a compatible license (e.g., Public Domain, CC-by-SA any, dual CC-by-SA/GDFL any, etc.). Consequently, all redistributed and derivative works of Wikitravel text must also be licensed as CC-by-SA 3.0. Files uploaded to Wikitravel are and must be licensed under any of the available options in the pulldown menu on the upload form . Consequently, all redistributed and derivative works including Wikitravel images and other files must provide file-specific attribution and licensing information, available on the individual file page. Two small subsets of images on Wikitravel may be copyrighted, and not available for redistribution or derivative works, although these copyrighted images will never appear in a Wikitravel article. For more information on these narrow categories of copyrighted images, see Template:Copyrighted . [ edit ] Things for users to know Copyleft means that every single author, editor, illustrator, mapmaker, factchecker and photographer who puts their work into Wikitravel gives you the right to read, copy, print, save, download, read aloud, project, modify, email, distribute, sell, photocopy and correct their work however you want to. The only restrictions are that: if you distribute it, or derive new work from it you must give attribution to the creators you must retain the work and any derivative works under the same licensing . Attribution In other words, we give you practically every freedom within the boundaries of the law to use the information in Wikitravel, except the freedom to take that freedom away from others. The license we use is the Attribution-ShareAlike license. It\'s a piece of legal documentation created by the great people at Creative Commons that basically says the same thing as above: give Wikitravellers credit for their work, and share with other people. If you want you can read the full text of the Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license . For the purposes of the License, a Work is the formatted text that makes up a single Wikitravel Shared article. Each file individually is also a Work for the purposes of the License. In addition, there may be other restrictions on use or distribution based on law in your country or state; in particular, consider privacy rights for photographs of people and derivative works for photographs of buildings and artworks. Lastly, to the extent possible there is no warranty on any of the articles or images in Wikitravel. Hotels close; bars raise prices; train schedules change; earthquakes, mudslides, wars and lightning strikes destroy sights, statues and cities. People make mistakes. Wikitravellers try their best, but none of the creators of these pages are responsible to you in any way for any injury or discomfort you endure before, after, or during your travels. See the License above for details. If you\'re setting up a mirror web site, you might want to check out How to re-use Wikitravel guides . [ edit ] Things for contributors to know Share-Alike Copyleft means that every single yahoo, nutcase, screwjob, charlatan, shyster, weirdo, freakazoid, mouthbreather, goofball, lamer, cheater and jerk will have the right to read, copy, print, save, download, read aloud, project, modify, email, distribute, sell, photocopy and correct your work however they want to. In particular , your work can be ruthlessly modified, edited, or cut from Wikitravel altogether by other Wikitravellers . It can be photocopied thousands of times and passed around as flyers by itinerant backpackers. It can be put in Hollywood movies, and it can be projected onto a screen at an outdoor rave. It can be used for commercial ventures, advertisements, or other purposes (with some restrictions - see privacy rights ) without your direct control. In return for your incredible generosity , you will have the knowledge that you are helping travellers all over the world, and that all copies made of your work will be attributed to you, and that everyone who derives new works from yours will have to be just as generous as you are. And, of course, you get to use all the other work in Wikitravel Shared the same way; but you don\'t need to contribute to do that. You\'ll also get the pleasure of collaborating with hundreds of other Wikitravellers just like yourself. You\'ll get free spellcheck service from nit-picky folks you\'ve never met. You\'ll work together with people you don\'t know to make better pictures, text, and maps than you\'ve ever dreamed of. You still retain the copyright over your own work, and you can use it any other way you want (even if it\'s not compatible with our license!). By writing on Wikitravel, or uploading photos, you\'re using a license under which all our work is available - making it simpler for everyone. Now, the hard part: because of the Attribution-ShareAlike license, you are legally responsible not to put other people\'s copyrighted work into Wikitravel without permission. You are responsible for getting model releases from people you take pictures of, and you are responsible for any libel you include in your articles. Before editing Wikitravel articles or uploading pictures, you should read very carefully the full text of the Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license , and make sure that you agree to it. For images, it\'s important to mark the image as either your own work, or give information on who made the picture and why you think it\'s acceptable under the broad terms of Attribution-Sharealike that govern Wikitravel\'s licensing. See Wikitravel Shared:Image policy for more information. We want to make the best possible travel guide, with the most brilliant writing, the most up-to-date info, the most awe-inspiring photos, the most detailed and readable maps. But no one item is worth putting yourself and this project in legal jeopardy. If you have any questions about the source of something you want to put in Wikitravel, ask about it first . When in doubt, leave it out. [ edit ] Frequently asked questions By = Attribution [ edit ] What do I need to do to get writing? Nothing , just plunge forward! Whenever you save something you write, you automatically license it for use under CC-by-SA 3.0. So all you need to do is get started writing\xe2\x80\x94if the text is your own original writing, don\'t worry about licenses. [ edit ] What do I need to do to get uploading images? First, be sure that the image is either one created by you or one that is freely licensed (see "Can I copy text and other content to Wikitravel from other sites?" below). Second, you should register an account on Wikitravel Shared, the central repository for Wikitravel files. Then, go to the upload screen , where you select the file to upload and enter an upload summary. The summary must include a choice of license from the pulldown menu, as well as attribution information indicating how you wish to be credited. If the image is not your own, be sure to provide accurate licensing and attribution information, as well as a link to the source from which you got the image. The simplest way to make sure everything is correctly documented is to use the image credit template (see How to upload files for detailed instructions). If the template seems too intimidating, an acceptable comment might be: Image copyright 2006 by [[User:YourNameHere]], dual-licensed under the CC-SA 1.0 (or later) and the GFDL. Taken by [[User:YourNameHere]]. There are some additional restrictions in specific cases (such as when photographing people) so please also read our Image policy . [ edit ] How will I be attributed? You will only be attributed for text contributions if you register a user account. Whatever you enter as your "real name" will appear in the revision history of any pages you modify, serving as attribution. If you register, but decline to enter a "real name," you will be attributed by your user name. For files you upload, you must provide the attribution information yourself in the upload summary. So, just indicate however you want to be attributed as you upload the file! [ edit ] Can GFDL content be used on Wikitravel? See also: Why Wikitravel isn\'t GFDL This is complicated. In a nutshell: Text licensed under any version of the GFDL is not compatible with Wikitravel. Images that are licensed under GFDL 1.3 or later , including eg. "GFDL 1.1 or later", are compatible with Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 and can be uploaded to Wikitravel Shared. Images licensed (only) under GFDL 1.2 or earlier are not compatible with Wikitravel and cannot be used. [ edit ] Can I copy text and other content to Wikitravel from other sites? Usually No . That is, unless you are the original author of the text, or the other website has been explicitly licensed as compatible with Creative Commons Attribution/Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0, or it is in the public domain. If you are the original author of the text, note that on the article talk page, or else someone will likely remove it as a copyright violation. Wikimedia projects like Wikipedia have a compatible license, so we can copy relevant text (although copying significant amount of text is discouraged). When copying content from another site with a compatible license be sure to provide proper attribution, as required by the CC-by-SA license. This means citing the license, author and source of images on any image page, and noting the license, author and source of text content on the article talk page . For the content to be public domain, it needs to be created by the US Federal Government, the city government of Washington, D.C., or have a statement on the website saying it is released into the public domain. Lack of a copyright notice does not mean the content is free to re-use\xe2\x80\x94all online content is automatically copyrighted unless the author explicitly states otherwise. [ edit ] If content is available free-of-charge, can it be used here? Probably not. Just because a map, brochure, or other item is given away for free does not mean that it has been freely licensed . For content to be usable on Wikitravel the content copyright owner must agree to license it under the CC-SA 3.0 or a compatible license. [ edit ] How should I ask for permission to use a forum reply on Wikitravel? The following template can help. Please quote your original message and reply to it at the respective article\'s Talk page. You may provide attribution to the original author(s) listing them by a template like en:Template:Attribution . Hi (person name). Do you mind if I use some pieces of your post (<forum post URL>) to contribute to an article on <destination> at Wikitravel, a free online travel guide written and edited entirely by travelers from around the globe? The current edition of the article I am going to update is here: <article URL>. Wikitravel requires that all the content is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license. Basically this means that your content: - can be distributed by others, as long as you are credited as the author - may be further edited by other contributors So do you mind if I use your text at Wikitravel? <your signature> You may also use the following text, which you need the copyright holder to clearly acknowledge: I hereby assert that I am the creator and/or sole owner of the exclusive copyright of WORK [the filename]. The text of this web page is available for modification and reuse under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribute Share-Alike, version 3,0 and earlier. I acknowledge that I grant anyone the right to use the work in a commercial product, and to modify it according to their needs, as long as they abide by the terms of the license and any other applicable laws. I am aware that I always retain copyright of my work, and retain the right to be attributed in accordance with the license chosen. Modifications others make to the work will not be attributed to me. I am aware that the free license only concerns copyright, and I reserve the option to take action against anyone who uses this work in a libelous way, or in violation of personality rights, trademark restrictions, etc. I acknowledge that I cannot withdraw this agreement, and that the work may or may not be kept permanently on a Wikitravel project.

S'How to re-use Wikitravel guides - Wikitravel Shared "Wikitravel has a speed and convenience the books\' publishers can only envy." \xe2\x80\x94 Time Europe How to re-use Wikitravel guides From Wikitravel Shared Jump to: navigation , search Wikitravel articles and images are available under a copyleft license. This means you can redistribute and modify them in any medium, as long as you follow a few simple rules. [ edit ] The short answer To redistribute Wikitravel content, you must: Attribute the authors of the content (Not just Wikitravel). Clearly note that the Wikitravel text content as being available under the CC-by-SA 3.0 license, and note the specific copyright for each image. There are no other requirements. [ edit ] About our license Our license, the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 , requires three main things from people redistributing an article: You give attribution to the authors of the article. You make any derivative works available under the same license. You notify readers and other users of the license. The following is our interpretation of the license requirements. It is not legal advice . [ edit ] Attribution You can give attribution to the authors according to their real names (preferred) or Wikitravel user names. For users identified with an IP address instead of a user name, you can use "Anonymous" or "Anonymous user of Wikitravel". You don\'t have to list any name more than once. [ edit ] Text Every page on Wikitravel has a credits block at the end of the page; for pages where all the authors names will fit in it, this should be sufficient for attribution. However, when there are too many authors names to fit in that block, you must follow the others link at the end of the block to get the complete set of credits for attribution. Each Wikitravel article also has an HTML link element of type meta that points to an RDF file with the author names. This may be easier to parse automatically. Sample wording : This page is based on work by John Smith, Jane Jones and other users . Alternatively, you may choose to simply point back to the credits of the original Wikitravel article: Sample wording : A list of contributors is available at the original article on Wikitravel. [ edit ] Images For images, the author history can (only) be found on the corresponding Image: page. Images often have image specific licensing and attribution which differs from the article itself, so you should double check the image file page before redistributing or creating derivative works, to make certain you provide accurate licensing & attribution information. [ edit ] ShareAlike Any redistributed Wikitravel articles or derivative works based on Wikitravel articles must also be licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0. Redistributed images or derivative works based on Wikitravel images must remain under the same license as appears on the individual image page (it is necessary to "click through" the thumbnail to get to individual image pages). [ edit ] Notice You must provide a link to the Attribution-ShareAlike license to notify readers and users of their rights to the article text or image. The URL of the license should be sufficient. Sample wording : Content on this page is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license . [ edit ] Practice These are some practical notes for re-using Wikitravel guides. wikitravel.org is a service for creating and editing these free guides. We can\'t support the bandwidth and processing requirements of uses not tuned to this purpose. We prefer not to serve files or articles if they\'re framed or embedded into other pages. If you create a Web mirror, it can help if you put a link on en:Wikitravel:Mirrors . [ edit ] Link back Wikitravel articles are written, edited, and illustrated by readers. Our quality improves when readers can fix factual errors, misspellings, or other make other improvements. For this reason, we ask that you also link back to the original Wikitravel article, allowing your readers to update it. This is just a request; it\'s not part of the license requirements. A link back is not a substitute for following the terms of the license. [ edit ] API A MediaWiki API for programmatic access to the site is available at http://wikitravel.org/wiki/ code /api.php, where code is one of the language versions of Wikitravel, eg. "en" for English. When using the API, please follow the terms of use and download no more than one article every 30 seconds, or you may be blocked without warning. [ edit ] XML data feeds Ideally, it would be possible to obtain XML data dumps of Wikitravel content, to facilitate the reuse of Wikitravel content, in line with the intent of the Attribution-ShareAlike license and the goals of this site. Internet Brands , the company that owns Wikitravel\'s servers, has expressed the wish to restrict access to XML data dumps and to consider requests for them on an individual basis. To date no one has actually obtained an XML data dump from Internet Brands. Please see en:Wikitravel:Database dump for more details.

Small wages. Bitter cold. Long months of complete darkness. Constant danger. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in case of success." -- Apocryphal recruitment poster for 1914 Antarctic expedition of HMS Endurance Wikitravellers are members of a world-wide community of contributors to Wikitravel . Wikitravel hasn\'t been around long enough to get any distinct idea for what kind of people Wikitravellers are, but it\'s probably safe to say that people who are involved with Wikitravel care about travel in general, and about sharing knowledge with others in particular. Wikitravellers are not a special secret organization or a limited group. We\'re people just like you, interested in travel, and willing to share what we know. You can become a Wikitraveller right now ! We need your help to make this project a success. We have a long way to go -- and anything you can do to contribute gets us that much closer.

But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document\'s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work\'s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public. A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document\'s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document\'s license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version\'s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties\xe2\x80\x94for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements". 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation\'s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document\'s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/ . Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy\'s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document. 11. RELICENSING "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site. "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization. "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document. An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008. The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page: Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation License". If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the "with \xe2\x80\xa6 Texts." line with this: with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation. If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.

S'No Cost or Freedom? - Gutenberg No Cost or Freedom? From Project Gutenberg, the first producer of free ebooks. Jump to: navigation , search The word free in the English language does not distinguish between free of charge and freedom . Free of charge means that you don\'t have to pay for the book you received. Freedom denotes that you may do as you like with the book you received. This distinction is immaterial if you just want to read a book privately, but it becomes of utmost importance if you want to work with the book: you are a teacher and want to use the book in class, you wrote a thesis about the book and want to distribute the book along with your thesis, you have a literary web site and want to distribute the book to your audience, or you are a writer and want to adapt the book for the stage. If the book you got is just free of charge , you may do none of the above things. You may not even make a copy of the book and give it to your best friend. But if the book you got is free as in freedom you may do anything you like with that book. Clearly free as in freedom beats free of charge . Fortunately almost all Project Gutenberg ebooks are free of charge and free as in freedom . Here are some real world examples of what people did with Project Gutenberg ebooks . A few Project Gutenberg ebooks are copyrighted. You can tell by reading the license inside the book. You may download a copyrighted book and give copies away, but might be limited in commercial uses and derivative works. Why are these books free? Copyright for most of these books has expired in the United States. (They may still be copyrighted in other countries). So anybody may make verbatim or non-verbatim copies of those works.

Sister Projects Project Gutenberg of Australia Project Gutenberg of Australia provides books which are in the public domain in Australia. As a general rule the works of authors who died before 1955 are in the public domain in Australia. Works by George Orwell (died 1950), Virginia Woolf (died 1941), and James Joyce (died 1941), just to name a few authors, are in the public domain in Australia. Of course, works which are in the public domain in Australia may remain copyrighted in other Countries, even for several decades. People may not download, or read online, such works if they are in a country where they are still under copyright. That still leaves a lot of readers out there to enjoy etexts of some of the greatest literary works of the twentieth century. Project Gutenberg of Australia also provides a list all of the Project Gutenberg etexts (from both the US and Australian Collections) which were written by Australians or which relate (although loosely) to Australia, and has an extensive collection of books by and about the land and sea explorers who opened up the continent to white settlement.

What are the "Etext/Ebook numbers" on the texts? 4.6 R.39. What do the month and year on the text mean? About Finding eBooks R.1. How can I find an eBook I\'m looking for? For PG books, the simplest way is to go to the Online Search page , type the Author or Title into the search form, press the "Search" button, and follow the choices. There also is a full-text search available. More finding and browsing options are available at the Online Catalog page . R.2. Can I get a complete list of Project Gutenberg eBooks? Yes. GUTINDEX.ALL is the raw list of files posted. When we post a book, the posting information contains title and author, eBook number, base filename and schedule year and month. For books after 10,000, it just contains title, author and eBook number, since that is all we need to find books after 10,000. This raw information goes into GUTINDEX.ALL. After posting, the text is automatically cataloged, with limited information. Later, our catalogers get to work and add more information \xe2\x80\x94 things like full title, subtitle, author birth and death dates, Library of Congress Classification, full filenames and sizes. When a book has been cataloged, it is entered onto the website database so that you can search for it. People who want to bypass the search on the website and find books themselves may want to use GUTINDEX.ALL, since it doesn\'t wait for the cataloging. GUTINDEX.ALL is updated weekly, usually on Fridays. R.3. How can I download a PG text without using the web catalog? We have to divide this question into two answers, for books up to 10,000, and books after 10,000, or reposted since we moved past 10,000. Books posted after 10,000 go into a new, simpler, naming scheme. Books REposted after we passed 10,000 (around November 2003) also use this scheme. We are reposting many older books, with improvements and corrections, all the time, and older books may also be reposted into the new scheme. You can see clearly from the line in GUTINDEX.ALL whether the book is in the old naming scheme or the new naming scheme. Where the line starts with a Month and Year, and contains a file-name template in square brackets, the book is still in the old scheme, for example: Feb 2005 Mike, by P. G. Wodehouse [mikewxxx.xxx] 7423 The line for the same book, in the new naming scheme, would omit the Month and Year, and the filename base, and look like: Mike, by P. G. Wodehouse 7423 Books after 10,000 \xe2\x80\x94 the new naming scheme To find a text with a number over 10,000, or one that has been reposted since we passed 10,000, you must know the eBook number. You can get this from GUTINDEX.ALL Once you know the number, you can find the directory containing all formats of it. Formally, the directory for the eBook will be contained in a hierarchy of directories, each one a single digit, being all the digits of the etext number except the last, in order. The name of the directory for the eBook itself will be the number of the eBook. But it\'s easier to see by example. The files for eBook number 10214 will be found in the directory 1/0/2/1/10214 on the download site you choose. So, for example, if you are downloading eBook 10214 from our main site by HTTP from http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/ , you can just go to http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/1/10214/ and download whichever of the formats you want. Or, instead of typing in the whole address, for numbers beginning with the digit "1", you can just go to http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/ and navigate down the list of directories. Books before 10,000 \xe2\x80\x94 the old naming scheme In short, just browse to: http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/ choose the schedule year of the text (newly-posted texts will usually be in the latest year) and look down the list to find the filename you\'re looking for. In general, you need to know: the address of an FTP site the schedule year of the text you want the basename of the text you want. The fastest and safest FTP site to use for this is ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org , which is the first of our two primary posting sites (the other being ftp://ftp.archive.org ). We post to these two sites, and then other sites copy from them at intervals, so with any FTP sites other than these two, the file may not be available immediately. You can get the schedule year and basename of the text from its line in GUTINDEX.ALL. Let\'s take an example. The file Mar 2004 The Herd Boy and His Hermit, by C. M. Yonge [#32][hrdbhxxx.xxx]5313 has been posted just a few hours ago as I write this. From the GUTINDEX entry, the schedule year is 2004, and the basename of the text is hrdbh. We divide our texts into directories (folders) based on the schedule year, so this eBook will be in the directory for 2004, which will be named something ending in /etext04. All the directories are named etext plus the last two digits of the year. (Somebody\'s going to have to change that convention in about 87 years from now!\xc2\xa0:-) We currently have directories starting at 90, running through the 90s and then 00, 01, 02, 03, 04. All eBooks produced before 1991 are in the /etext90 directory, so if you\'re looking for Dec 1971 Declaration of Independence [whenxxxx.xxx] 1 or Aug 1989 The Bible, Both Testaments, King James Version [kjv10xxx.xxx] 10 you should look in /etext90. As it happens, ibiblio supports both HTTP (web) and FTP access to the text, so we can just browse to http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/ and choose the 2004 directory from there. If you want to automate this, you could also use the more direct address ftp://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04/ The equivalent address for ftp.archive.org is ftp://ftp.archive.org/pub/etext/etext04/ Either way, we see a long page of files, in alphabetical order. Scroll down to the "H"s and look for hrdbh. We see four files with this basename: hrdbh10.txt hrdbh10.zip hrdbh10h.htm hrdbh10h.zip This means that both plain text and HTML formats are available, and you can choose to download them either zipped or uncompressed. See this FAQ entry for more detail about conventions for filenames . The main thing you need to know is that any file beginning with hrdbh is some format or edition of this book. Finally, all you have to do is click on the format you want to download. R.4. You don\'t have the eBook I\'m looking for. Can you help me find it? Sorry, no. We can suggest (see below) some other places to look for publicly accessible books on the Net, but we can\'t do the search for you. R.5. Where else can I go to get eBooks? The Online Books Page specializes in creating a list of all books on-line from any source. Searching there is a good place to start. If you\'re looking for commercial books, like current textbooks or bestsellers, you\'re not likely to find them here, since recent books are not in the public domain. For these, you should look for commercial booksellers on the Net \xe2\x80\x94 any search engine will direct you to some if you enter search terms like "shop ebook". R.6. I see some eBooks in several places on the Net. Do different people really re-create the same eBooks? It does happen, but mostly by accident. Anyone experienced in eBook creation will first search the usual places to see whether anyone else has already transcribed the book they\'re interested in. If it has been transcribed, they will not duplicate the effort. Etexts that are in the public domain very often float around the Net for years \xe2\x80\x94 stored in a gopher server here, posted to Usenet there, held on someone\'s local computer for a year or two and then reformatted as HTML and uploaded to a web site somewhere else. And this is good, because we want texts to be copied as widely as possible. Public domain eBooks are fair game for anyone to copy, correct, mark up, package and post: that\'s what being in the public domain means. Project Gutenberg eBooks are often quickly copied and reformatted, and posted on other sites like Blackmask Online and Steve Sakoman\'s site at http://www.sakoman.net/ . Unfortunately the Blackmask Online website is down due to a lawsuit about the copyright of the Doc Savage books. If you find an eBook in many different places, the odds are good that it came from one original source, and was copied around. It does sometimes happen that people duplicate the transcription of books already made into text. Sometimes it\'s because they didn\'t find the version already made. Sometimes they have a different edition, and want to transcribe that. Mostly, though, we all try not to do more work than we have to. About Using the Web Site R.7. Why couldn\'t I reach your site? (or: Why is your site slow?) There may be a bottleneck somewhere else between you and the site. If at first you don\'t succeed, don\'t tell us, just try, try again. The correct address is: http://www.gutenberg.org/ R.8. I get an error when I try to download a book. Many FTP sites throughout the world hold the whole Project Gutenberg archive of texts. An FTP site is just a computer on the Internet that specializes in holding files for download and sending them to people on request. You can find a list of FTP sites that hold Gutenberg texts at http://www.gutenberg.org/MIRRORS.ALL . When you\'re searching or browsing for titles and authors, you\'re on this Project Gutenberg site, but if you choose one of the mirrors, or another method of downloading, when you click on the book to download it, you are connected to an FTP (or HTTP) site. At the time you click on the filename, your browser contacts an FTP site and tries to download the file from there. If you get an error, it could be because the FTP site is busy, or because there\'s a network traffic bottleneck between you and that FTP site, or because the text you\'re looking for is missing from that FTP site. Usually, the easiest solution is to choose another FTP site to download your text from. Go to the Search page, choose a different FTP site, and search again for your text. Tip: You should always try to choose the FTP site closest to you. Not only are you helping to minimize Net traffic by choosing a nearby site, but your file will download faster! If all else fails, note the year and the filename of the book you want, if it\'s below number 10,000, or its number, if above 10,000, choose an FTP site from this list and click on one of them. Then browse your way through the listings to the file you want. For example, if you find Lady Susan by Jane Austen, you will see that it was published by Gutenberg in 1997, and its filename is lsusn10.txt, so browse to one of the FTP sites, choose the directory called /etext97 and click (or right-click and Save, depending on your browser) on the file lsusn10.txt. Or, in the case of Clarissa, Volume 6 by Richardson, which is #11364, you will find it in the directory /1/1/3/6/11364 R.9. I searched for a book I know is in Project Gutenberg, but got no results. First go to the Advanced Search page. Sometimes you may miss in searching because of alternative spellings, so try searching separately using just one word in Author or Title. Read the Search Tips. If that fails, you can Browse through the site catalog. Let\'s say you\'re looking for The Wandering Jew by Eugene Sue. Go to the Online Catalog page. Once on this page, click on: "S" in "Authors:" You should now see a list of all of the Authors whose last name starts with "S". Scroll down till you find the direct links to the Sue, Eugene works. Click on the work you are interested to, then click on the file link found on the page you were brought to, Etext 3350 when selecting the work, as immediately above. On this page, above the excerpt, there are download links: Click on the link of your choice - plain text or zipped, and from ibiblio.org or other. If you choose one of the mirrors, you are then brought to a new page, asking you to select an "Download site". Further details on how and why to choose an "FTP Site" are available on this page. Select a site, and the file will be downloaded, or offered for download, depending on which format you selected and which browser you use. If you can\'t find your text either way, the book has not been cataloged. If you know that the book has been posted recently, and maybe hasn\'t made it into the catalog yet, read: How can I download a PG text without using the web catalog? If even this doesn\'t help, don\'t despair! We don\'t have it, but it may be elsewhere on the Web. Go to the major search engines and try there. You can also try looking in the Book Search section of The Online Books Page , and if you have no luck with that, you might be able to find it listed as being In Progress somewhere on their Books In Progress and Requested page. R.10. Can I copy your website, or your website materials? No. Keeping the PG site updated with the latest e-text releases is an ongoing job, and our experience is that people, however well-intentioned, do not keep copies up to date. We want there to be one clear source for people seeking the latest Project Gutenberg information, and we think that having a lot of out-of-date copies and partial copies scattered around the net would be a Bad Thing. We welcome mirrors and copies of our e-texts, in new FTP sites (see: Can I become an FTP mirror? ), but the main web site itself is copyrighted and may not be copied. R.11. Your site doesn\'t look right in my browser. I clicked on a button, and nothing happened. We take a lot of trouble to ensure that our website uses only valid, standard HTML, and we\'re not even slightly tempted to use glitzy features that look good in one browser but don\'t work in another, so we can promise you that our site is not the problem. If you actually clicked on a button, like the Search button, and nothing happened, you might be behind a proxy or web filter that doesn\'t like you making POST requests. If you have a web filter switched on, turn it off, reload the page and try again. R.12. What does that thing about "mirror sites" mean? Our texts are not actually held on the website. The website just holds an index; the files themselves are held on many sites throughout the world, called FTP sites. When you have found the book you\'re looking for, and you make that final click to get it, you\'re not actually talking to our website any more \xe2\x80\x94 you are transferred to the FTP site you selected. Some FTP sites are near you; some are far away. Some may be faster than others, even if they are about the same distance; some may have temporary technical problems. You should usually select the FTP site nearest you. If you find you\'re having problems with that one, you can select another. R.13. What exactly is an FTP site anyway? FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, one of the oldest and most reliable protocols of the internet. This is the method by which a file can be copied from one computer to another. We now have some HTTP (web) sites containing eBooks as well, including our main site at http://www.gutenberg.org/ . You can use either HTTP or FTP. An FTP site, or FTP server, is a computer that holds files that people can upload and download. In the case of PG, the Posting Team upload our texts when they\'re ready to two main FTP servers, ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org and ftp://ftp.archive.org , which serve as our master copies. Other FTP sites around the world automatically download the files from these master sites, so they have a full set of PG publications for you to download. Because they only check for updates and new files at intervals, some FTP sites may be a day or two behind. Some FTP sites don\'t have space available for everything, so they may hold only the zipped versions of the files. But most FTP sites will have the entire PG collection. These are called FTP "mirrors", since they are a copy of the original. Many FTP sites exist that offer a full PG mirror but are not on our FTP sites list. Commonly, these are in schools, where they serve the local students, but don\'t have enough bandwidth to offer downloads to worldwide users. R.14. Can I become an FTP mirror? Yes! We\'re always looking for more FTP mirrors. If you manage an FTP site with 100 GB or so of free space, please check our Contact Information page and contact the appropriate person, who will make the arrangements for you. R.15. Can I make a private FTP mirror for my school, library or organization? Yes. We like all FTP mirrors to be open to as many people as possible, but we know that not all schools have the resources to be a public mirror, so we welcome all mirrors. And anyway, you don\'t even have to ask, because we don\'t control what happens to our texts once we post them! R.16. When I clicked on the file I want, nothing happened. When you select a file for download, your request goes to the FTP site you selected, not to our website. If the FTP site you selected is having problems, or if there is the Net version of a traffic jam between you and it, you may have problems downloading. Select a different FTP site (see: What does that thing about "mirror sites" mean? ) and try again. R.17. How many texts are downloaded through the web site? Go to the Top 100 Page . R.18. What are the most popular books? Go to the Top 100 Page . These numbers vary a lot. When a movie based on a classic is released, downloads of that eBook go through the roof! About Downloading and Using Project Gutenberg eBooks R.19. Should I download a ZIP or a TXT file? If you know how to unzip a file, then downloading the zip is faster. For some non-text eBooks that contain multiple files, like HTML with included images, only a zip file may be available. For some other formats, like MP3 or MPEG, there may not be a zipped version available because the native format of the file is already compressed enough that zipping it doesn\'t save much. R.20. I\'ve got a ZIP file. What do I do with it? Unzip it. If you want a free program, you could try the open source Info-Zip software available at http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/tools/zip/info-zip/ for Mac, MS-DOS, Unix, Windows and just about everything else you might have. If you want a commercial program, PKZIP from http://www.pkware.com and WinZip from http://www.winzip.com are among many popular shareware utilities that allow you to unzip files. Mac-users using Stuffit Expander may like to set a preference (File / Preferences / Cross Platform) to "Convert text files to Macintosh format \xe2\x80\xa6 When a file is known to contain text". This gets rid of strange characters (linefeeds), which are not wanted on a Mac, at the beginnings of lines. MacZip is another free program for Macs. Mac users can also try ZipIt or other shareware programs available from the Info-Mac archives, e.g. from ftp://mirrors.aol.com/pub/info-mac/_Compress_&_Translate/ . R.21. I tried to unzip my file, but it said the file was corrupt, or damaged. The chances are that it didn\'t download correctly. Try downloading it again. If you don\'t succeed the second time, try downloading the unzipped version. R.22. I see gibberish onscreen when I click on a book. To save download time, our etexts are stored in zipped form as well as text form. Zipped files are smaller, and take less time to transfer to your computer, but you need a program to unzip them. If you try to view a zipped file directly, it looks like gibberish. You can recognize zipped files easily because their filenames end in .zip. If this happens, either make sure you\'re asking your browser to Save the file rather than display it (often, you right-click the file and choose Save) or else click on the version of the file that ends in .txt instead of .zip. You don\'t need a zip program to view .txt files. Looking at a zip rather than a text file is by far the most common reason for this problem, but there are some others. If you\'re quite sure that you\'re not looking at a zip file, then it could be that the file you downloaded is in a character set that your viewer doesn\'t recognize, like Big-5 [V.78] for Chinese texts, or Unicode [V.77]. If this is the case, you will have to find a viewer that works on your computer for the specified character set. We may also have an ASCII version of the same text available for you \xe2\x80\x94 we do try to have ASCII versions for everything [G.17], but some languages, like Chinese, just cannot be sensibly expressed in ASCII. If you can see most of the characters, enough to be able to make out the text, but there are regular gibberish characters, black squares, empty boxes or obviously missing characters scattered about through words, then you are probably looking at an "8-bit" text [V.79], with accented characters, and your viewer doesn\'t handle the character set. See the FAQ "I can read the text file, but a few characters appear as black squares, or gibberish" [R.31]. If there are a very few gibberish characters, black squares or obviously missing characters in the text, then it\'s likely that this was intended to be a 7-bit text, but a few 8-bit characters like the British pound symbol or accented letters slipped through. R.23. Can I download and read your books? Yes. That\'s what Project Gutenberg is all about \xe2\x80\x94 making texts available free to everyone! R.24. What am I allowed to do with the books I download? Most Project Gutenberg e-texts are in the public domain. You can do anything you like with these \xe2\x80\x94 you can re-post them on your site, print them, distribute them, translate them to other languages, convert them to other formats, or redistribute them in unchanged form. However, if you distribute versions under the Project Gutenberg trademark, we do impose some conditions, which are explained in the header and/or footer in each text. Some Project Gutenberg e-texts have copyright restrictions. You can still download and read these, but you may not be allowed to reproduce, modify or distribute them. When browsing or searching on the site, you will see these copyright-restricted texts indicated in the listings. For fuller information about them, download the e-text and read the header or footer of the file, which will spell out the conditions in detail. R.25. Does Project Gutenberg know who downloads their books? No, and we don\'t want to! Like any Internet transfer, our sites have to know the IP addresses that contact them; without that, no communication is possible. But we do not trace, hold or examine them beyond what is necessary to deal with any problems or maintain logs or statistics. We never identify IP addresses with people. Further, we encourage people, sites, schools around the world to mirror, or copy, our texts to their sites. Once that happens, we have no control over them, and we never have any idea who or even how many people access them after that. Even further, we encourage people to distribute the texts on disks, CDs, paper, and any other storage format they can find. We encourage them to convert the texts to other formats, and share them. For most people reading this, anonymity is probably not an issue, but you may live in a place or time where reading Paine, or Voltaire, or the Bible, or the Koran, is considered suspicious or even subversive. We don\'t know who you are, and what we don\'t know, we can\'t tell. Currently (2004), by means of DRM (Digital Rights/Restrictions Management) many commercial publishers can make a list of exactly who is reading which of their eBooks. We don\'t know, and we don\'t want to know. R.26. I\'ve found some obvious typos in a Project Gutenberg text. How should I report them? The first thing to remember is that the people who actually make the corrections you suggest are very experienced, and are used to seeing lots of different types of errata reports. So the exact format of your report isn\'t really very important \xe2\x80\x94 just get the report to us in any clear form that we can understand. Beyond that, here are some tips to avoid misunderstandings. It\'s always helpful if you report the full title, etext number, year and filename of the text you are correcting. We have multiple editions and versions of some texts, like Homer\'s "Odyssey", and unless you tell us exactly what text you mean, we may have to spend some time searching and guessing. Especially, please check and report the exact filename of the text. It is amazingly common for people to report problems with abcde10.txt, when abcde11.txt is already posted, and has these and other errors already fixed. When there are only a few errors, it\'s usually easiest to cut and paste the line or lines where the error is into your e-mail, with your comment. It can also be useful to give the line number of the place where the error is, and some people who check texts regularly do this. If this seems natural to you, do it; if it doesn\'t, don\'t. An ideal report for a typical errata list might look like: Title: The Odyssey, by Homer Translated by Butcher & Lang April, 1999 [Etext #1728] File: dyssy08.txt Line 884: back Telemachus, who bas now resided there for a month. "bas" should be "has" Line 1491: Ithaca yet stands. But I wouldask thee, friend, concerning "would" and "ask" are run together here Line 1563: in his father\'s seat and the elders gave place to him This is the end of a paragraph, and needs a period at end. Line 15346-7: \'Hearken to me now, ye men of Ithaca, to the will say. Through your own cowardice, my friends, have I think there is something missing between "the" and "will" But the following would get the job done as well: In Homer\'s Odyssey, translated by Butcher and Lang, from /etext99, file dyssy08.txt, I found the following errors: Telemachus, who bas now resided change "bas" to "has" But I wouldask thee, "would ask" run together and the elders gave place to him needs period ye men of Ithaca, to the will say. line missing between "the" and "will"? Where there are more than, say, 50 changes, it may be easiest all round just to submit a corrected version of the file. However, if you do this, please do not re-wrap the paragraphs unless it is absolutely necessary (and I can\'t think of a case where it might be, since we can re-wrap texts too); we need to check your suggestions before reposting, and if the file is very different, it is difficult and time-consuming for us to find your real changes among all of the changes in the lines. Instead just add a comment in your mail like "I think this text needs rewrapping." If you are a regular, and have used any of the standard Gutenberg tools like Gutcheck or Guiguts to find errors, please don\'t list these in your mail. We will be running gutcheck and a basic spellcheck as standard on every updated text that we repost, and it just wastes time to have lots of duplicates. You might just mention something like "gutcheck finds a lot of bad quotes"; we\'ll know what to do from there. Please concentrate your report on the errors that we won\'t find, or might miss, with a standard automated scan. R.27. I\'ve found some obvious typos in a Project Gutenberg text. Who should I report them to? The Posting Team, who post the books, also make the corrections, and ultimately, the corrections need to go to them. Visit the Contact Us page for the current email address of the errata team (it is changed periodically to cut down on spam). Many producers put their e-mail addresses in their texts, specifically so that readers can contact them when errors are found. If you see that in your text, you should try to contact the producer first. This is especially true if the corrections aren\'t obvious, as in the case of missing words. The producer is likely to have the original book, and will probably be able to confirm your corrections without visiting a library. If the book needs the corrections, the producer can then notify the Posting Team. If you get no response from the producer, or if there is no e-mail address listed, or if the corrections are small and obvious, you should send them to the email address for reporting errors listed on the Contacts Page where members of the posting team will deal with them. R.28. I\'ve reported some typos. What will happen next? This varies wildly. Sometimes, you may just get a response e-mail in a day or three saying thanks, and that we\'ve fixed the typo. This is normal when you\'ve just reported one or a few obvious typos. Where there is some text missing, or the changes you suggest are otherwise not obvious, we may have to find someone with an eligible copy of the book to confirm the changes, and that might take time. Normally, you will get an e-mail explaining that within a week. Sometimes, even though you\'ve noticed only one or two small typos, one of the Posting Team who was looking at it may find many more, and decide that the whole text needs to be re-proofed. This may also take time. If the text needs a lot of changes, we may post a new EDITION [R.35] of it, with a new filename: e.g. abcde10.txt may become abcde11.txt. In this case, you will receive a copy of the e-mail sent to the posted list announcing the new file. Our current rule of thumb is that we create a new edition when we make twelve significant changes, but we judge each on a case-by-case basis, and especially will usually not make a new edition if the original was posted recently. R.29. I\'ve got the text file, and I can read it, but it seems to be double-spaced or it has control characters like ^J or ^M at the end of every line. This is most often seen on Mac or Linux. If you want to dig into why this effect happens, see the FAQ "Why use a CR/LF at end of line?" [V.85]. Perhaps viewing it in a different editor or viewer will help, but it\'s usually easiest just to globally replace all of the control characters (if you see them) with nothing, or to replace all double line-ends with single line-ends. R.30. When I print out the text file, each line runs over the edge of the page and looks bad. If you have a file ending in .txt from Project Gutenberg, it is usually formatted with about 70 characters per line, and with a Carriage Return/Line Feed pair (also known as a "Hard Return" or a "Paragraph Mark") at the end of every line. This is the most widely accepted format for text files, but it\'s not ideal on all computers and all programs. 70 characters per line means that if you are using an unusually large or small font to print it, lines may wrap around or not reach across the page. The hard return means that on some systems, the lines may appear double-spaced. Unfortunately, we can\'t advise you how best to format texts on all systems, mostly because we don\'t know every system! Here are a couple of tips you might try: If your font is too big or too small, try setting the font to Courier size 10 or Times size 12. It may not be ideal, but it mostly works. In a word processor, you may be able to remove the Hard Returns, but beware! if you remove too many, the whole text will become one paragraph. One common formula for removing the HRs goes like this: First, all paragraphs and separate lines should be separated by two HRs, so that you can see one blank line between them. Where they aren\'t, as in the case of a table of contents or lines of verse, add the extra HRs to make them so. Replace All occurrences of two HRs with some nonsense character or string that doesn\'t exist in the text, like ~$~. Replace All remaining HRs with a space. Replace your inserted string ~$~ with one HR. R.31. I can read the text file, but a few characters appear as black squares, or gibberish. The text is using some character set that your editor or viewer isn\'t. For example, the text is using ISO-8859-1, and your viewer is using Codepage 850 \xe2\x80\x94 or vice versa. You can see the plain ASCII characters, but non-ASCII characters like accented letters display as nonsense. Look at the top of the file for a clue to the character set encoding: if it\'s there, it may help you to find which editor, or font, or viewer you should be using. R.32. Can I get a handheld device for reading PG texts? Which device should I get? To read eBooks on a handheld, you need three things: the eBook content itself (which you can get from PG and other sites), a device (which I will sometimes call a PDA, even though technically, the RocketBook isn\'t a PDA) and the reader software that runs on the PDA. In mid-2002, there are three main families of handheld devices people use for reading eBooks: Palms, Pocket PCs and RocketBooks (or their successor, REB1100s). In general, it is possible to use any of these in combination with any common type of personal computer. Palms are very common, especially when you count not just the Palm http://www.palmone.com/us/ itself, but PalmOS-based devices from other manufacturers, like: the Franklin eBookman http://www.franklin.com/ebookman/ the Handspring Visor http://www.handspring.com the Sony Cli\xc3\xa9 http://www.sony.com Because of the number of makers of PalmOS-based devices, you can buy them with lots of combinations of features \xe2\x80\x94 color screen, audio, different memory sizes. Of course, Palms have other applications besides eBook reading. Palms are the smallest and most portable of the three classes, and tend to have the best battery life for travelling, but they also have the smallest screen. Just about all reader software will run on Palms, except the Microsoft Reader, which runs only on Pocket PCs, but you don\'t need the Microsoft Reader for Project Gutenberg eBooks. In Pocket PCs, the Compaq iPaq http://www.hp.com and the Dell Axim http://www.dell.com are by far the most common at the end of 2003. More expensive and bulkier than a Palm, they have a bigger screen. Like the Palms, they can perform many functions besides reading eBooks. Only Pocket PCs can support the Microsoft Reader, but this is not necessary for reading Project Gutenberg eBooks. The RocketBook, and its successor the Gemstar REB1100, are quite different from the others. These were built specifically for reading eBooks, and do not have additional functions. They are not, technically, PDAs. Their screens are bigger, and excellent for reading, but do not offer color. They also don\'t offer a choice of readers \xe2\x80\x94 the dedicated reader is built-in to the device. Both of them require the eBooks you load to be formatted for their reader, and files made for them usually have the extension .rb for RocketBook. The REB1100 did not come with the RocketLibrarian, which is the program you run on your PC to turn an etext into a RocketBook file, but people are still making .rb files, and the RocketLibrarian is still available and popular among an enthusiastic group of Rocket users. (The REB1200 is entirely different from the REB1100, and, as far as we know, PG etexts cannot easily be transferred to it.) In late 2003, Gemstar discontinued their eBook reader range, but there are many still around. In summary, the Rocket/REB1100 is a dedicated reader, with a good screen, but limited to what it does. Palms are relatively cheap and common, with a wide range of options, and the capacity to function as PDAs as well. They can run all common readers except the Microsoft one. The iPaq http://www.hp.com has a good color screen, but is bulkier than a Palm, and can run lots of readers, including the Microsoft one, but not all Palm readers are available for Pocket PC. Like Palms, the iPaq can do other jobs besides displaying eBooks. Different people make different choices among these for reading their eBooks, and they all work well; it\'s a matter of personal taste. How can I read a PG eBook on my Palm? These steps work for all devices running the Palm OS. Install the free Plucker Viewer on your Palm Download the eBook in the "plucker" format to your desktop Sync the plucker file to the Palm using your favorite desktop application How can I read a PG eBook on my PDA (not Palm)? To read a book on your PDA, you need to get the file into a format that your reader software understands. Each PDA reader program will work only with a specific format of file. Some will read several formats, but, in general, it\'s a jungle of competing options. Unless you use a Rocket or REB1100, you will need to install at least one reader program, and many veteran readers install two or three to deal with different formats. There are many of them available. One of the most used is the Mobipocket Reader . Further, the process may be different depending on which reader software you\'re using. Each format that a reader understands has one or more converter programs that run on your PC, and turn the plain text file into that format. So in general, you have to: Download the PG text Edit the text for the layout the converter wants (often HTML). Use the converter to create a file of the format the reader wants. Transfer the converted file to your PDA. If all this sounds too complicated, remember that many people take and convert PG texts into many formats, and offer them for download from their sites. Of course, there is no guarantee that someone will have converted the particular eBook you want, but there are lots of options. Try Blackmask , which lists thousands of texts already converted for Mobipocket, iSilo, RocketBook and the Microsoft Reader. There are many other sites that serve pre-converted PG texts. MemoWare is also a useful resource for converted eBooks, and has lots of information, including an excellent map of the readers and formats jungle . Steve Sakoman\'s site at http://www.sakoman.net/ takes plain texts from PG and produced automated conversions to HTML and PalmDOC PDB. If you\'re "rolling your own", you\'ll probably need to convert our plain texts to HTML at some point, because a lot of converters require HTML as input, and this is a common theme in readers\' explanations of how they get texts onto their PDAs. Don\'t panic! You don\'t have to be a HTML wizard to do this \xe2\x80\x94 in fact, you don\'t need to know anything about HTML at all! Usually, it\'s just a matter of removing some line ends and Saving As HTML. You won\'t get a lot of fancy markup, or images out of thin air, but you will get the book. One of the main things you usually have to do in making HTML is unwrap the lines. If you\'re making your HTML manually, this is usually done by replacing two paragraph marks with some nonsense marker like @@Z@@, replacing all single paragraph marks with a space, and replacing the nonsense marker with a paragraph mark. After unwrapping, the text can just be Saved As HTML. This has the drawback that lines that shouldn\'t be wrapped \xe2\x80\x94 like poetry, tables or letter headings, will be wrapped. You may have to go through the text and add extra line breaks for these. There are some applications that specifically assist with auto-converting text into HTML: GutenMark http://www.sandroid.org/GutenMark was specifically written for the purpose, and knows enough about PG conventions to do a very good job.

S'The CD and DVD Project - Gutenberg The CD and DVD Project From Project Gutenberg, the first producer of free ebooks. Jump to: navigation , search Project Gutenberg periodically generates CD and DVD image files (ISO files) containing books from the collection. When downloaded, they can be used to make a CD or DVD using a CD or DVD writer. Note that you will need a dual layer burner in order to burn our dual layer DVD. If you\'d rather not burn a physical disc, the ISO files can also be mounted on most systems. Here are instructions for mounting our latest DVD under Linux , though these instructions should work for any of our ISOs. Please copy and give away these CDs and DVDs! Keep one for yourself, and give one to a friend \xe2\x80\xa6 or a library \xe2\x80\xa6 or a school. These CD and DVD compilations are copyrighted and licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 1.0 license . Individual files should be consulted for individual licenses, including the Project Gutenberg Trademark License ("small print") . Verbatim copies of the Project Gutenberg \'Best Of\' CD may be sold provided that 20% of the gross proceeds are donated to Project Gutenberg, however, none of the DVDs may be sold, as they contain some material which is copyrighted. These CD and DVD images (and the CDs and DVDs they can be used to create) should run on all computer systems. Many files on the DVDs are compressed using Zip; most modern computers (and many older ones as well) have an unzip program built-in, or you can find a free unzip program on the Internet for your computer.

The December 2003 DVD contains 9400 of our first 10,000 books. The July 2006 DVD contains over 17,000 books from our first 19,000 titles. The March 2007 Science Fiction Bookshelf CD contains most of our science fiction titles. The April 2010 (Dual Layer) DVD contains 29,500+ books. All of the books found on the 2003 CD can also be found on all of the DVDs and most of the files on the December 2003 DVD can be found on the July 2006 DVD. Likewise, most of the books on the July 2006 DVD can also be found on the April 2010 DVD. There are very few images on the discs, and no audio books. If these compilations are not to your liking, you can create your own CD or DVD image containing only the books you want. What the Discs do not Contain For the most part, the original copyright on the materials distributed by Project Gutenberg has expired. This means that most of the books on the discs are at least 80+ years old, and you will almost certainly not find information about computers, video games, or other topics that you may be studying in school (unless perhaps you are an English major studying at a liberal arts college). The materials on a Project Gutenberg disc will not substitute for the textbooks that you are required to purchase. (Even if you are an English major, your professor will likely assign a particular edition of the books you will read.) There is no information on Microsoft Windows, Linux, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii, or Sega DreamCast. You will not find any information on defeating copy protection or how you can obtain "warez." If you are looking for any of these things, please do not download or request copies of the Project Gutenberg discs. It would be a waste of our limited time and money. How to download The CD and DVD images are distributed as ISO files. One ISO file contains all of the data for one disc, so they tend to be large. these images may take some time when downloading via a modem or other slow connection. At 56K, the zipped versions of the CD ISOs could take up to 24 hours to download, and each single layer DVD will require about 11 days, with the dual layer DVD requiring about twice that. The time will of course be a fraction of that when downloading over a high-speed connection. Downloading Via BitTorrent BitTorrent is our recommended way to download the images. Not only does it tend to be quite fast, but it also insures that you receive an error-free copy of the files. In order to download via BitTorrent, you will need a BitTorrent Client. You can download the official BitTorrent client from http://www.bittorrent.com , or you can use one of the many other clients available on the internet. See here for a list and comparison of various BitTorrent clients . See here for more information about BitTorrent in general . Once you have BitTorrent installed, you only need the torrent file for the image you wish to download. You can Usually obtain these torrent files from The Project Gutenberg BitTorrent Tracker . You can also get the torrent files from the below links: The August 2003 CD The July 2006 DVD The March 2007 Science Fiction Bookshelf CD The April 2010 (Dual Layer) DVD Or, if your client supports magnet links, you might try the following: magnet:?xt=urn:btih:SMVFOYIXEKAC7DGLK3T4JFKA5S3EOOZR&dn=pg2003-08.zip&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fsnowy.arsc.alaska.edu%3A6969%2Fannounce \xe2\x80\x94 The August 2003 CD magnet:?xt=urn:btih:KR6A7743VOOKQWZOZQMPS5DORPFKPIZW&dn=pgdvd072006.iso&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fsnowy.arsc.alaska.edu%3A6969%2Fannounce \xe2\x80\x94 The July 2006 DVD magnet:?xt=urn:btih:PCHVSDZIU6M4YEAJVG3YBNSJ7VXQULUR&dn=PGSFCD-032007.zip&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fsnowy.arsc.alaska.edu%3A6969%2Fannounce \xe2\x80\x94 The March 2007 Science Fiction Bookshelf CD magnet:?xt=urn:btih:DKNULNDJWCFN4M7DIM7QK7XH4YYMJF5E&dn=pgdvd042010.iso&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fsnowy.arsc.alaska.edu%3A6969%2Fannounce \xe2\x80\x94 The April 2010 (Dual Layer) DVD Downloading Via Edonkey/Emule If you have a program which uses the Edonkey Protocol, you might try the following links: for the July 2006 DVD, ed2k://|file|pgdvd072006.iso|4626251776|F149537F97E9B2FF57A28712FA70CC6A|h=MAIUF5WXX3C5ZZ7C2SDKCNSGITLSODX2|/ for the December 2003 DVD, ed2k://|file|The.Project.Gutenberg.DVD.December.2003.Edition.pgdvd.iso|4139646976|02CEB6E1E07A0CDC98757134B0678B14|/ For the December 2003 CD, ed2k://|file|The.Project.Gutenberg.CD.August.2003.Edition.-.PG2003-08.zip|387828452|0485242D72E3B440D7D9FD61F0ED44DD|/ for the March 2007 Science Fiction Bookshelf CD, ed2k://|file|PGSFCD-032007.zip|154915573|E5EE354281E500B29BC29B61BDBBC26E|h=3P7ANYCATOMLK4IQTOONBKLOSLP7WDXR|/ If the above ed2k links are not clickable from your browser, you may need to copy and paste them into your edonkey aware application.

Please note that we have received numerous reports of the images not arriving intact when downloading via FTP, especially from those using DSL or cable connections. Therefore, in order to insure an error-free download, we strongly recommend you use one of the other methods, such as bittorrent, whenever possible. The August 2003 DVD and the July 2006 DVD can also be found on most of our FTP sites as a multi-part RAR file. Programs for extracting RAR files can be found at RAR Labs. Downloading Via HTTP Due to the size of the files, this method is strongly discouraged and is not supported. If you attempt to download via HTTP, it is probable that your download will be truncated by the server because it is too large. Verifying Your Download If you downloaded via BitTorrent or Edonkey, you can be quite certain that your download was error free.

We offer both a high resolution PNG and an original .PSD file . If you\'ve created any labels for our discs you\'d like to share, please let us know. If You Cannot Download We would prefer you download the CD or DVD images, as described above. But if you are unable and would like a copy in the mail, Project Gutenberg volunteers will send you a copy free of charge. (You are invited to make a donation to offset our costs.) To request a free CD and/or DVD, please use either our United States or International request form. Due to the high volume of requests, we are no longer able to accept requests via email, unless the form doesn\'t work for you. If you must make an e-mail request: send your name, postal address, and country (we will not use it for any other purpose) specify whether you want a CD or DVD please also tell us why you were unable to use the form, including a copy of any error message you might have received send to: cd2010_AT_pglaf.org (replace the _AT_ with the @ sign) After you submit the form or send your email, we\'ll respond to let you know we got your request, and will send a CD or DVD as soon as we can. Since the CDs and DVDs are produced by volunteers (using their home computers), we cannot guarantee fast delivery. Discs are sent via USPS or other inexpensive method. Generally, the discs are hand-labeled and will arrive in a simple wrapper. We do not have a program in place to send discs to other people on your behalf. Note that we are only mailing copies of the April 2010 DVD and the August 2003 CD. The other images are only available for download. Creating a Custom CD or DVD Not Currently Available : One of our volunteers has created a web service which will allow you to create a custom CD or DVD with as much or as little of our content as you like. You can specify which authors, titles, languages, ETC. you would like included. Complete documentation is available in the FAQ at the site. Please note that we are unable to mail you a copy of any custom CDs or DVDs you create. How You can Help If you are interested in volunteering to help us distribute discs, please see our DVD Project Volunteering page. International Copyright PGLAF is committed to complying with copyright laws. PGLAF has not verified that all the eBook files on these discs meet the copyright laws in countries outside of the United States. PGLAF recommends that you verify this before using these files and requests that you advise us of any problems (see the Contact Information page ).

S'The Project Gutenberg License - Gutenberg The Project Gutenberg License From Project Gutenberg, the first producer of free ebooks. Jump to: navigation , search The Project Gutenberg License Explained (informative) This section tries to explain the salient points of the Project Gutenberg license using English. You may want to skip to the Full Project Gutenberg License in Legalese (normative) . Contents 1 The Project Gutenberg License Explained (informative) 1.1 Public Domain Books 1.2 Copyrighted Books 1.3 Using the Project Gutenberg Trademark 2 The Full Project Gutenberg License in Legalese (normative) 2.1 START: FULL LICENSE 2.2 Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works 2.3 Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm 2.4 Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation 2.5 Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation 2.6 Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. For nearly all uses, in nearly all parts of the world, the opening words of all of our eBooks apply: "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org." Details follow. The Project Gutenberg license is hard to understand because it addresses three distinct things: your rights, our limited warranty, the use of the Project Gutenberg trademark. It also addresses two categories of ebooks: public domain books whose copyright has expired in the United States, and copyrighted books whose author gave Project Gutenberg permission to distribute them. Public Domain Books These books are in the public domain in the United States and everybody \xe2\x80\x94 including Project Gutenberg and you \xe2\x80\x94 may read and distribute them. If you don\'t live in the United States you\'ll have to check the laws of the country you live in before downloading and distributing our ebooks. A Project Gutenberg ebook is made out of two parts: the public domain book and the non public domain Project Gutenberg trademark and license. If you strip the Project Gutenberg license and all references to Project Gutenberg from the ebook, you are left with a public domain ebook. You can do anything you want with that. Copyrighted Books Some authors give Project Gutenberg permission to distribute their book(s). This permission does not automatically expand to include you. If you want to distribute a copyrighted ebook you found on PG, you have to contact the author and stipulate an agreement. N.B. The catalog will tell you if an ebook is copyrighted, but sometimes the catalog is wrong. Always look at the license inside the ebook to tell if it is copyrighted or not. Using the Project Gutenberg Trademark If you want to use the name Project Gutenberg anywhere in the ebooks you distribute or on the distribution medium or in advertising you have to obey these rules: you may only distribute verbatim copies of the ebooks. No changes are allowed to the ebook contents. (Though reformatting the ebook to a different file format is considered okay). If you charge money for the copies you distribute, you have to pay royalties to Project Gutenberg. You must refund your clients for defective copies or if they don\'t agree with the Project Gutenberg license. If you don\'t agree with any of the above mentioned restrictions, you may not use the Project Gutenberg trademark. You may still distribute the ebooks if you strip the Project Gutenberg license and all references to Project Gutenberg. The Full Project Gutenberg License in Legalese (normative) Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be renamed. Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks. Redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

S'Michael S. Hart - Gutenberg Michael S. Hart From Project Gutenberg, the first producer of free ebooks. Jump to: navigation , search Contents 1 Michael Stern Hart (1947-2011) 1.1 Obituary for Michael Stern Hart 1.1.1 Eulogy for Michael S. Hart 1.2 Message from Michael\'s Family 1.3 Read some of Michael\'s recent writings 1.4 Collection of Links Michael Stern Hart (1947-2011) Obituary for Michael Stern Hart Michael Stern Hart was born in Tacoma, Washington on March 8, 1947. He died on September 6, 2011 in his home in Urbana, Illinois, at the age of 64. His is survived by his mother, Alice, and brother, Bennett. Michael was an Eagle Scout (Urbana Troop 6 and Explorer Post 12), and served in the Army in Korea during the Vietnam era. Hart was best known for his 1971 invention of electronic books, or eBooks. He founded Project Gutenberg, which is recognized as one of the earliest and longest-lasting online literary projects. He often told this story of how he had the idea for eBooks. He had been granted access to significant computing power at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. On July 4 1971, after being inspired by a free printed copy of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, he decided to type the text into a computer, and to transmit it to other users on the computer network. From this beginning, the digitization and distribution of literature was to be Hart\'s life\'s work, spanning over 40 years. Hart was an ardent technologist and futurist. A lifetime tinkerer, he acquired hands-on expertise with the technologies of the day: radio, hi-fi stereo, video equipment, and of course computers. He constantly looked into the future, to anticipate technological advances. One of his favorite speculations was that someday, everyone would be able to have their own copy of the Project Gutenberg collection or whatever subset desired. This vision came true, thanks to the advent of large inexpensive computer disk drives, and to the ubiquity of portable mobile devices, such as cell phones. Hart also predicted the enhancement of automatic translation, which would provide all of the world\'s literature in over a hundred languages. While this goal has not yet been reached, by the time of his death Project Gutenberg hosted eBooks in 60 different languages, and was frequently highlighted as one of the best Internet-based resources. A lifetime intellectual, Hart was inspired by his parents, both professors at the University of Illinois, to seek truth and to question authority. One of his favorite recent quotes, credited to George Bernard Shaw, is characteristic of his approach to life: "Reasonable people adapt themselves to the world. Unreasonable people attempt to adapt the world to themselves. All progress, therefore, depends on unreasonable people." Michael prided himself on being unreasonable, and only in the later years of life did he mellow sufficiently to occasionally refrain from debate. Yet, his passion for life, and all the things in it, never abated. Frugal to a fault, Michael glided through life with many possessions and friends, but very few expenses. He used home remedies rather than seeing doctors. He fixed his own house and car. He built many computers, stereos, and other gear, often from discarded components. Michael S. Hart left a major mark on the world. The invention of eBooks was not simply a technological innovation or precursor to the modern information environment. A more correct understanding is that eBooks are an efficient and effective way of unlimited free distribution of literature. Access to eBooks can thus provide opportunity for increased literacy. Literacy, and the ideas contained in literature, creates opportunity. In July 2011, Michael wrote these words, which summarize his goals and his lasting legacy: \xe2\x80\x9cOne thing about eBooks that most people haven\'t thought much is that eBooks are the very first thing that we\'re all able to have as much as we want other than air. Think about that for a moment and you realize we are in the right job." He had this advice for those seeking to make literature available to all people, especially children: "Learning is its own reward. Nothing I can say is better than that." Michael is remembered as a dear friend, who sacrificed personal luxury to fight for literacy, and for preservation of public domain rights and resources, towards the greater good. This obituary is granted to the public domain by its author, Dr. Gregory B. Newby. Eulogy for Michael S. Hart As spoken by Newby at Michael\'s funeral, September 12 2011 (this sequence of words is granted to the public domain): "Rather than speak in whole sentences, which can be difficult at times like these, I will speak a series of words that characterize Michael. These words might help you to form your own memories of him. Friend. Visionary. Leader. Intellectual. Anti-Elitist. Digital Literati. Rebel. Frisbee Player. Hippie. Musician. Technician. Enthusiast. lover of Much and Many. Full of Passion. Scout. Veteran. Patriot. Pacifist. Humanist. Egalitarian. Educator. Man of the People. Builder. Maker. Speaker. Listener. Systems Analyst. Friend." Message from Michael\'s Family The family prepared a document with an image of Michael, "breaking down the bars of ignorance and illiteracy." The message is part of this PDF file and contains this text: Thank you for your kind thoughts at this time. Michael will be truly missed by his family \xe2\x80\x93 by his friends \xe2\x80\x93 and by the world\xc2\xa0!! Please keep breaking down the bars\xc2\xa0!!

What is StrokeIt? StrokeIt is an advanced mouse gesture recognition engine and command processor. What is a mouse gesture? Mouse gestures are simple symbols that you "draw" on your screen using your mouse. When you perform a mouse gesture that StrokeIt can recognize, it will perform the "action" associated with that gesture. In short, it\'s a nifty little program that lets you control your computer by drawing shapes with your mouse. How do I perform a gesture? Click and hold down the right mouse button and then draw the mouse gesture you want performed. You can temporarily disable StrokeIt by holding down the Control key, or right clicking on the StrokeIt icon in the system tray. If you want to cancel a mouse gesture you\'ve already started drawing, simply left click. What mouse gestures does StrokeIt come pretrained to recognize? StrokeIt can recognized more than 80 unique mouse gestures. Who created StrokeIt? StrokeIt was written entirely by Jeff Doozan . How big is it? The installer is around 140k, with the recognition engine weighing in around 15k. Normal memory usage varies by system, but is generally is between 90k and 300k. StrokeIt does not require any additional files or libraries. Is it really free? Yes, StrokeIt is free for individual and not-for-profit charitable entity use (excluding governmental entities and educational institutions). For-profit business entities, governmental entities, or educational institutions can purchase licenses for only $10/ea. Can I use StrokeIt technology in my own program? You sure can! Grab the SDK and start coding. It\'s easy to create plugins that will interact with your applications. Can I bundle StrokeIt with my program Distribution Licenses are available for developers who would like to bundle StrokeIt with their applications.\n'

PhoneGap Legends is a fantasy/RPG themed demo that leverages HTML DOM animation techniques and targets webkit browsers. I was able to get some really outstanding performance out of this example, so be sure to check out the video and read the details below. The name \xe2\x80\x9cPhoneGap Legends\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything; I just thought it sounded videogame-ish and appropriately fitting. PhoneGap Legends This game demo is an infinitely-scrolling top-view RPG themed game that is implemented entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is a scrolling background, enemy characters, HUD overlays, and of course, our \xe2\x80\x9cprotagonist\xe2\x80\x9d hero \xe2\x80\x93 all that\xe2\x80\x99s missing is a story, and general game mechanics like interacting with sprites. Again, I was able to get some *really outstanding performance* out of this sample, so I wanted to share, complete with source code, which you\xe2\x80\x99ll find further in this post (and I encourage you to share it too) . Take a look at the video below to see the game in action on a variety of devices. Every single bit of this is rendered completely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript \xe2\x80\x93 there are no native portions of the application. Disclaimer: This sample app is by no means a complete game or complete game engine. I\xe2\x80\x99ve implemented some techniques for achieving great performance within a PhoneGap application with game-themed content, but it still needs additional game mechanics. I also wrote this code in about 2 days \xe2\x80\x93 it needs some additional cleanup/optimization before use in a real-world game. Source Full source code for this demo application is available on github. This code is provided as-is:\xc2\xa0 https://github.com/triceam/PhoneGap-Legends . I will be making a updates over the next few days in preparation for GDC next week, but for the most part, it is stable. Development Approach The PhoneGap Legends application was built following the performance tips that I posted earlier this month . The game is built so that it uses a game loop based upon requestAnimationFrame to perform all UI updates. This gives it a scheduled interval that is in sequence with the browser\xe2\x80\x99s redraw cycle. In general, the DOM is as shallow as possible for achieving the desired experience. All \xe2\x80\x9csprites\xe2\x80\x9d, or UI elements are basic DOM nodes with a fixed position and size. \xc2\xa0All DOM elements have an absolute position at 0,0 and leverage translate3d for their x/y placement. \xc2\xa0This is beneficial for 2 reasons: 1) It is hardware accelerated, and 2) there are very, very few reflow operations. \xc2\xa0Since all the elements are statically positioned and of a fixed size, browser reflow operations are an an extreme minimum. The background is made up a series of tiles that are repeated during the walk/movement sequence: Sprite Sheet for Background Tiles In the CSS styles, each tile is 256\xc3\x97256 square, with a background style that is defined for each \xe2\x80\x9ctype\xe2\x80\x9d of tile: .tile{ width: 256px; height:256px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top:0px; left:0px; background-repeat: repeat; background-clip:border-box; } .tile_0 { background: url(\'../images/background_tiles.png\'); background-position: 0px 0px;} .tile_1 { background: url(\'../images/background_tiles.png\'); background-position: 256px 0px;} .tile_2 { background: url(\'../images/background_tiles.png\'); background-position: 512px 0px;} .tile_3 { background: url(\'../images/background_tiles.png\'); background-position: 0px 256px;} .tile_4 { background: url(\'../images/background_tiles.png\'); background-position: 256px 256px;} The content displayed within each of the \xe2\x80\x9csprite\xe2\x80\x9d DOM elements is applied using sprite sheets and regular CSS background styles. Each sprite sheet contains multiple images, the background for a node is set in CSS, and the position for each image is set using the \xe2\x80\x9cbackground-position\xe2\x80\x9d css style. \xc2\xa0For example, the walking animation for the hero character is applied just by changing the CSS style that is applied to the \xe2\x80\x9chero\xe2\x80\x9d <div> element. Sprite Sheet for Hero There is a sequence of CSS styles that are used to define each state within the walking sequence: .hero_0_0{ background: url(\'../images/rpg_sprite_walk.png\'); background-position:0px 0px;} .hero_0_1{ background: url(\'../images/rpg_sprite_walk.png\'); background-position:0px 96px;} .hero_0_2{ background: url(\'../images/rpg_sprite_walk.png\'); background-position:0px 192px;} .hero_0_3{ background: url(\'../images/rpg_sprite_walk.png\'); background-position:0px 288px;} ... This game demo extensively uses translate3d for hardware accelerated composition. \xc2\xa0However, note that the 3d transforms are all applied to relatively small elements, and are not nested. All of the \xe2\x80\x9ctextures\xe2\x80\x9d are well below the max texture size across all platforms (1024\xc3\x971024), and since it use sprite sheets and reusable CSS styles, there are relatively few images to load into memory or upload to the GPU.

Sharon McKellar Less than two weeks ago, Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s 5 Point Cafe \xc2\xa0became the first known establishment in the United States (and possibly the world) to publicly ban Google Glass , the highly anticipated augmented reality device set to be released later this year. The \xe2\x80\x9cNo Glass\xe2\x80\x9d logo that the caf\xc3\xa9 published on its website was developed and released (under a Creative Commons license) by a new London-based group called \xe2\x80\x9c Stop the Cyborgs .\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0The group is composed of three young Londoners who decided to make a public case against Google Glass and other similar devices. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\'s just a few geeks wearing it, it\'s a niche tool [and] I don\'t think it\'s a problem,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, 27, who prefers only to be identified by his first name. He communicated with Ars via Skype and an encrypted Hushmail e-mail account. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if suddenly everyone is wearing it and this becomes as prevalent as smartphones\xe2\x80\x94you can see it becomes very intrusive very quickly. It\'s not about the tech, it\'s about the social culture around it. If you think about what Google\'s business model is, it started as a search engine, and then Google Analytics. [Now, Google is] almost characterizing its [territory as being] the rest of the world. It\'s a loss of space that isn\'t online. [Google Glass] destroys having multiple identities, and I find that quite a scary concept.\xe2\x80\x9d Adam admitted he has never actually used or interacted with Google Glass in person, but he said he has extensive experience with augmented reality and currently is a post-doctoral student specializing in "machine learning" at a London university that he declined to name. He added that he and two friends are behind Stop the Cyborgs. Google has yet to release much detailed information about Google Glass, only allowing small trials involving its own employees \xc2\xa0and select journalists and developers . Stop the Cyborgs\' anti-Glass logo. \xe2\x80\x9cMost people [have] no idea what they were looking at\xe2\x80\x9d On the Stop the Cyborgs site, the group raises a significant concern: namely, that there\xe2\x80\x99s no obvious way to know when the device is on or what it\xe2\x80\x99s actually doing (recording or not). Indeed, Adam\xe2\x80\x99s fears may be warranted, based on The Verge\xe2\x80\x99s own experience last month : At one point during my time with Glass, we all went out to navigate to a nearby Starbucks\xe2\x80\x94the camera crew I\xe2\x80\x99d brought with me came along. As soon as we got inside however, the employees at Starbucks asked us to stop filming. Sure, no problem. But I kept the Glass\xe2\x80\x99 video recorder going, all the way through my order and getting my coffee. Yes, you can see a light in the prism when the device is recording, but I got the impression that most people had no idea what they were looking at. The cashier seemed to be on the verge of asking me what I was wearing on my face, but the question never came. He certainly never asked me to stop filming. Plus, it\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to imagine a situation where photos taken by Glass could be checked against Facebook, Google+, or another social network. For now, Google hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said what sort of facial recognition capability Glass will (or could) have. "Google Glass is possibly the most significant technological threat to \'privacy in public\' I\'ve seen," Woodrow Hartzog, an affiliate scholar at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School, told Ars. "In order to protect our privacy, we will need more than just effective laws and countermeasures. We will need to change our societal notions of what \'privacy\' is." For now, at least one privacy-minded senator doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem worried. "In the past, Google has taken a principled position in making facial recognition an opt-in service for its social network, Google+,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) in an e-mail to Ars. \xe2\x80\x9cThis gives me hope that this same kind of thoughtfulness will be applied to its roll-out of Glass. I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to talking to Google more about its deployment of Glass and what it means for privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d Sharon Ron-McKellar took this photo of Ars editor Cyrus Farivar using Google Glass\xc2\xa0at an event in Oakland last month. Sharon Ron-McKellar \xe2\x80\x9cYou\'re never going to see a stranger as a stranger again\xe2\x80\x9d Still, though, we can only speculate about how society will react to such an expensive geek toy that will almost certainly spawn copycat devices that will get cheaper and more expansive over time. \xe2\x80\x9cIn generation two, when you\'ve got better battery life and apps that do better face recognition\xe2\x80\x94maybe we\'re crying wolf a little early to a certain extent\xe2\x80\x94but [what happens when] you get to competing products?\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe idea that you\'ll have recognition of objects and infrared tags so it will always know what you\'re looking at\xe2\x80\x94that kind of thing, it will be gathering information. It\'s more the face recognition stuff that changes society. You\'re never going to see a stranger as a stranger again.\xe2\x80\x9d That\'s a sentiment Hartzog\xc2\xa0echoed. "Google Glass simply lowers the transaction costs of taking photos and videos and learning about your surroundings," the law professor said. "If Glass has a high adoption rate, it will significantly increase the likelihood of information that was assumed to be obscure or ethereal being discovered, recorded, and subject to publication. The law has yet to figure out how to unravel the fact that there are many situations where individuals expect privacy in public. So perhaps the best approach to this, at least initially, is a vocal, context-based opposition." Even more interestingly, Adam admitted that part of why he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid of associating his name with such a campaign is that it might hurt his chances in the industry where he hopes to get a job. "I want to get a job with Google, eventually,\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cI\'m part of that industry, so anything that I say in regard to that site could come back and bite me. I might not be able to afford my principles.\xe2\x80\x9d Expand full story Promoted Comments DanNeely Ars Scholae Palatinae jump to post Quote: I want to get a job with Google, eventually,\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cI\'m part of that industry, so anything that I say in regard to that site could come back and bite me. I might not be able to afford my principles.\xe2\x80\x9d Unless "Adam" is a pseudonym and lying about other information he gave ars it\'s probably too late; just obfuscating his surname is almost certainly insufficient. I doubt there\'re multiple 27 year old Adam\'s working on machine learning Phd\'s in London universities today.

The recording laws of your jurisdiction don\'t suddenly change. If it\'s illegal to record others\' private conversations without consent now, it still will be when Glass hits the market. Small, easily concealed recorders have existed for many years already. There are plenty right now that cost a *fraction* of a Glass. No one is running around demanding that small, affordable recording devices be banned because they will destroy human decency. Well, probably someone is, but we have words for that kind of person. Will there be issues, foreseen and otherwise? Probably. But we\'ve been through this a hundred times in the past few decades. It is silly to be afraid of people wearing their smartphone on their ear instead of in their hand. If you don\'t want recording in your establishment, then why haven\'t you had a sign up saying so for a decade already? 489 posts | registered Apr 14, 2010 javierkatana Smack-Fu Master, in training jump to post So in japan due to cultural preferences by law is required that any mobile phone containing a digital camera must emit sound whenever a photograph is taken. Privacy is a valid concern but the law is the tool to enforce and limit what technology can do. If the world isn\xc2\xb4t ready yet for a technology that comes before the right questions are answered then better hurry up, Google glass will sell like hot cakes and for good. Why focus on what it takes from us and not think of what it brings to the table, like an easy to use interface for people with disabilities, or as mandatory tool for hired babysitters etc. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\xe2\x80\x9d Henry Ford. 3 posts | registered Jun 29, 2008 Reader comments 316 Cyrus Farivar / Cyrus is the Senior Business Editor at Ars Technica, and is also a\xc2\xa0radio producer and author.\xc2\xa0His book,\xc2\xa0The Internet of Elsewhere,\xc2\xa0was published in April 2011. @cfarivar \xe2\x86\x90 Older Story Newer Story \xe2\x86\x92 You May Also Like Top Feature Story Feature Story (3 pages) How I became a password cracker Cracking passwords is officially a "script kiddie" activity now. 69 Stay in the know with Follow Ars on Facebook Follow Ars on Twitter Follow Ars on Google Plus Sign Up for the Ars Newsletter Sign up for the Ars Technica Dispatch, which delivers links to the most popular articles, journals, and multimedia features via e-mail to your inbox every week.

Social: On Off a Share on FB Timeline: Episodes I\'m Watching Series I\'ve Followed Episodes I\'ve Loved Blip\'s mission and principles Blip\'s mission is to help people to discover the best in original web series and to help web series producers make a sustainable living. In pursuing our mission we adhere to a set of rigorous standards. Piracy Even with the Internet\'s ubiquitous distribution, close-to-unlimited inventory and easy duplication of media, Blip believes that rules of property still apply. Unauthorized distribution of someone else\'s content is theft. High-tech theft is just as wrong, both legally and morally, as low-tech theft. We police our site just like retailers police their stores, and we don\'t tolerate theft. Our producers work hard giving voice to their creativity in video, and we won\'t let anyone rob them of their effort. We also won\'t tolerate robbers showing their merchandise on our site. We are fans of "copyleft" licenses such as those offered by Creative Commons . We encourage everyone to look into Creative Commons licenses and adopt them. Every video released under a copyleft license enriches the (lowercase) creative commons in a significant way. Pornography We will not traffic in pornography. Blip is a place for series about ideas and entertainment. We want everyone to feel comfortable coming to our site and having their children and grandparents check it out as well. We\'re proud to be a venue for series that is well-lit, bright, organized and clean, and we are dedicated to keeping Blip exactly this way. Community We believe that producers and viewers are stakeholders in Blip as much as our employees, founders and shareholders. Blip was designed, and continues to evolve, with the goal of serving each of these communities. We make every effort to develop tools, technologies and environments that these communities can take pride in and find useful. We are dedicated to maintaining an excellent relationship with producer and viewer communities and their individual members, whether or not they are Blip users. We make every effort to participate in community forums and to be helpful in every way possible to members of the community. The original Blip was designed based on direct interaction with the videoblogging community. We continue to be grateful to this community and to seek advice from its members, even as the community has evolved and grown over the years. We still get great advice from producers and viewers at BBQs across the country and get-togethers around the world, and we\'re always open to making changes based on community feedback. At Blip, we see software development as a collaborative effort between our company and the communities it serves. Democratization We live in an age characterized by the democratization of expression. We love that professional and up-and-coming independent producers can create entertaining series and gain audiences of millions. We celebrate that they can produce original series as their full time job and make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, or more. Their only constraint is the limit of human creativity. We believe that this liberation of the means of production is one of the most important things to happen in recent history. It allows anyone to create the next great sitcom or to share the reality of daily life across cultural boundaries. This is a beautiful thing, and we are dedicated to furthering this democratization in a way that respects intellectual property rights and in a venue where everyone feels comfortable. Openness We live in an economy of plenty. We believe it is in the interests of the community and in the interests of Blip to be open with media and with data about media. At Blip we are not building a walled garden but instead are actively working to break down walls to enable the free and open sharing of media and metadata throughout the Web.

S'But Not Yet Razvan ME But Not Yet \xe2\x80\x9cThe lamp has gone out... and I\'m writing... in the darkness...\xe2\x80\x9d Aug 29, 2011 / 5:08am The Man and the Stone \xc3\x86sop was sent one day by his master Xanthus to see what company were at the public bath. He saw that many who came stumbled, both going in and coming out, over a large Stone that lay at the entrance to the bath, and that only one person had the good sense to remove it. He returned and told his master that there was only one Man at the bath. Xanthus accordingly went, and, finding it full of people, demanded of \xc3\x86sop why he had told him false. \xc3\x86sop thereupon replied that only he who had removed the Stone could be considered a man, and that the rest were not worthy the name. \xe2\x80\x94 The Book of Fables (John B.

Feb 15, 2010 / 7:10am The Books I like Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s useful to have a day set aside to celebrate the love for somebody else. In general, I find useful to spend time and think about the people and the things that make my life nicer and enjoyable. A week ago, while unpacking the last boxes from the relocation, I realized, once again, how much I love the books I have. I truly do. Their shape, their texture, the way they smell, the old yellow pages of some of them, the elegance of the type from others, the memories of the time I spend reading some of them\xe2\x80\xa6 all these small and big things make all them dear to me. Some are old and need to be handled with great care. Some are safely protected by well-made hardcovers. Some are shiny and untouched. Old friends, good friends, new friends. All are living peacefully, sharing a rack near the window. They don\xe2\x80\x99t fight for my attention. They are waiting patiently for the time I don\xe2\x80\x99t yet have. At some point I will. Jan 31, 2010 / 7:30am The Server Today I had to assemble one more rack in order to finally unpack the last round of boxes. In the process of placing it I had to turn off puppy, my home server. Unfortunately, the power supply started again to misbehave. As before, I open it up and blow the dust. The good news is that, after a few hiccups, it started working again, but the sounds I heard do not predict a very bright future. So I had to spend the some time to find and order a new power supply. While doing all these I realized something rather unexpected: that I wanted to be a father; I wanted a kid that is old enough to know how to use a computer and passionate about it to the extend of wanting to learn more about it. And I would have like to have the chance to give him (or her) a server. A machine that he could do whatever he want: use it, learn it, experiment with it, break it, fix it, take care of it. A machine that will, piece by piece, die, perhaps teaching him something useful in doing this. I know that this will probably not make sense some time for now. Everything is moving to the cloud and less and less people are willing to go through the hassle of managing their own machines. But we are not there yet and, in the same way some people like to fix their own cars, motorcycles, bikes or houses, there will be some that will also enjoy trusting their own servers. I hope that among the parents that try to give their children the best opportunities to discover their talent for arts and science there will be some that will give them a server to play. Dec 14, 2009 / 1:02am The End Oct 14, 2009 / 5:07am The Zen Master (fictional portrait) The Zen Master is by far the most remarkable patron of the late gym hours. As expected, the master is the epitome of grace and equilibrium. The master doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come too late or too early and is neither staying too long or too short. The right measure is something deeply embedded in almost everything the master does. The taste in clothing is refined and the few pieces of the gym attire are always pleasantly matched in both shape and color. The content of the training is tough, but not too tough, and very well organized. The beginning starts on the mat (same place each time) and it contains a healthy assortment of stretches followed by an intense set of several types of crunches. This last item is of particular importance because the master is also known as The Super Cruncher (not to be confused with another type of crunchers popular in some circles) due to the perfect technique employed in performing them. Next is a lap of walking followed by running. How many laps? Five (half a mile) is the magic number. The speed is much faster than one mile per minute but distinctively slower than a sprint. The running style is another distinctive feature of the master which sports an impeccable and elegant stride. Another lap of walking and another half a mile concludes half of the whole program. The very end is typically reserved for a vigorous series of jumps. Only after this the right amount of effort was properly achieved. In accordance with the rules of perfect harmony the master is never in a rush and the main parts are separated by brief breaks, usually including a walk to the water fountain. Like many other people the master is also using a portable audio player but, unlike many, this is never allowed to perturb the focus on the main activity. The master is a young blonde girl which never smiles. Her outstanding perseverance is inspiring and it will surely serve her well in the future. Oct 10, 2009 / 3:45pm Summary of the Baltimore Running Festival 2009 Today I run the Half Marathon from the Baltimore Running Festival . My finish time was 2:04:50 which placed me on the overall position 2895 out of 7815 (around the top 37% mark). In the Males 30-34 section I\xe2\x80\x99m probably deeper in the bottom half though. :P The average time per mile was 9:32 was better than I expected. One reason might be the fact that going downhill more than compensated the slowdown accumulated on the uphill sections. I just eat and not I\xe2\x80\x99m heading to bed for some rest so here some quick observations. Good stuff: finishing the race faster than I expected the combination of overcast and some showers made the race very enjoyable (and very Baltimore-style too :P) the random people cheering in various places the downhills! Until now I had now idea that I actually like them. :-) the gummy bears. In a few places gummy bears were offered to the runners. Beside being a funny thing in general it was even funnier so see them forming a trail on the running route. Cute! the meal (the regular breakfast I have each) I had when I got home tasted better than ever. Not so nice stuff: the places with the Gatorade drinks smelled like some medicine to me the smell of the portable rest rooms. There is not much to get things better I guess though. I have to say that I made a stop for one after about 6 miles and after that it was great. the blisters I got on my right foot. It was from a callus but it never gave me such problems before. Ignoring it was not wise though. Lesson learned. the last mile was much harder than I expected the heavy dizziness from the end due to the hard stop. There were so many people at the end that was impossible not to stop though. I lost about 1kg. Some random stuff: people stopping at Clifton Park to take a leak in the nature. Considering the smell of the alternatives I cannot blame them. no \xe2\x80\x9cKeep Plucking that Chicken!\xe2\x80\x9d cheering. I would have loved to hear this one. The explanation of the phrase would have made it perfect for anything after 6 miles. Especially for the last one. :-) Sep 9, 2009 / 3:35am Parlamentul Rom\xc3\xa2niei vs Congresul SUA Continu\xc3\xa2nd pe direc\xc8\x9bia din postul precedent iat\xc4\x83 ni\xc8\x99te grafice care arat\xc4\x83 prezen\xc8\x9ba la vot la cele dou\xc4\x83 camere ale parlamentului al\xc4\x83turi de cele dou\xc4\x83 camera ale congresului SUA. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Diferen\xc8\x9ba \xc3\xaentre c\xc3\xa2t de serioase sunt lucrurile la noi \xc8\x99i la ei e evident\xc4\x83.

Deci membrii congresului SUA au mai multe zile lucr\xc4\x83toare, o \xc8\x9bar\xc4\x83 seminificativ mai mare \xc8\x99i reu\xc8\x99esc s\xc4\x83 nici nu lipseasc\xc4\x83 aproape de loc. \xc3\x8en aproape 20 de ani de non-comunism se pare c\xc4\x83 mai avem mult p\xc3\xa2n\xc4\x83 s\xc4\x83 facem lucrurile cum trebuie. Nu am comparat \xc3\xaenc\xc4\x83 datele cu cele de la Vivi a\xc8\x99a c\xc4\x83 s-ar putea ca graficele s\xc4\x83 nu fie foarte exacte. Not\xc4\x83: senatul SUA are doar 100 de senatori. Num\xc4\x83rul de 103 e din cauza schimb\xc4\x83rilor care au mai avut loc. Acela\xc8\x99i lucru e valabil \xc8\x99i pentru camera reprezentan\xc8\x9bilor unde num\xc4\x83rul e de 441.

Aug 29, 2009 / 10:26pm The Story of a Simple and Dangerous Kernel Bug Among other things, the update for Mac OS X 10.5.8 also fixed an interesting kernel bug related to the way the fcntl call is handled. The bug was identified as CVE-2009-1235 and the first exploit seems to be from June 2008 . The variant that I discovered is much simpler and is, as far as I know, the one that really convinced Apple to solve the issue. :-) The oldest kernel I was able to test the problem was Darwin 8.0.1 which corresponds to Mac OS X 10.4 \xe2\x80\x9cTiger\xe2\x80\x9d. The Tiger was announce in June 28, 2004 but was released to the public on April 29, 2005 and it was advertised as containing more than 200 new features. The bug was closed on August 5, 2009 so the number of days the vulnerability was alive was 1599 days (4 years and 3 months). Here is a way to trigger a kernel panic using Python: import termios, fcntl fcntl.fcntl(0, termios.TIOCGWINSZ) The first paramter to fcntl.fcntl indicates a file descriptor and any open one (0 to 4 in Python) will work. The C variant is also very simple (it even fits in a tweet !): #include <fcntl.h> #include <sys/ioctl.h> int main() { fcntl(0, TIOCGWINSZ, 0); return 0; } As expected, this code will also generate a kernel panic when the first parameter for fcntl is 1 (stdout) or 2 (stderr). Let\xe2\x80\x99s now take a better look at what really happens. First, here is the correct version of the program: #include <stdio.h> #include <sys/ioctl.h> int main() { unsigned short buff[4]; ioctl(0, TIOCGWINSZ, &buff); printf("%d %d %d %d\\n", buff[0], buff[1], buff[2], buff[3]); return 0; } What the code does is obtaining the windows size. TIOCGWINSZ and other terminal related ioctl are fully explained in tty(4) . The output of the above program is the following: 24 80 484 316 The first two numbers are the height and length of the window in characters and the second is the same in pixels. The first parameter for ioctl is also a file descriptor and the above output is also obtained for 1 (stdout) and 2 (stderr). The size in pixels depends on the terminal program (in mrxvt 0.4.1 the two numbers are always zero). Comparing the two programs it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that the buggy one is erroneously using fcntl instead of ioctl. As incredible as might sound, I managed to do this by mistake. :P This should (obviously) not generate a kernel panic. The good news is that debugging a Darwin kernel is quite easy because Apple is providing Kernel Debug Kits which contains the debug symbols for all the shipped kernels together with some handy gdb macros. The fact that debug takes places over Ethernet is another useful thing. Investigating the call traces of the good and buggy program are like this: (buggy) unix_syscall --> fcntl_nocancel -------------------> VNOP_IOCTL --> cptyioctl --> ttioctl (non-buggy) unix_syscall --> ioctl --> fo_ioctl --> vn_ioctl --> VNOP_IOCTL --> cptyioctl --> ttioctl So both calls end up in the same place but taking slightly different paths. The end point in /bsd/kern/tty.c is the following: 963 case TIOCGWINSZ: /* get window size */ 964 *(struct winsize *)data = tp->t_winsize; 965 break; The problem is the data in the buggy case is whatever we give as a third parameter in the fcntl code. Considering that the 8 bytes are controlled by the user it means he can write that amount of information anywhere in the kernel memory! Pretty scary right? :-) A way to really show this is to overwrite some memory that is not used and the examine the region to see if it contains the right thing. Below is an example that is using iso_font for this. Here are the steps ( ten is the name of the target machine and it\xe2\x80\x99s a G4 running 10.4.7): (gdb) attach ten Connected. (gdb) print &iso_font $1 = (unsigned char (*)[4096]) 0x433268 So iso_font is located at 0x433268. (gdb) x/4hx iso_font 0x433268 <iso_font>: 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 And as expected, the first 8 bytes are zero. (gdb) c Continuing. Next I run the buggy code with the 0x433268 as the third parameter. The program was this: #include <fcntl.h> #include <sys/ioctl.h> int main() { fcntl(0, TIOCGWINSZ, 0x433268); return 0; } When I run this the system didn\xe2\x80\x99t crash. What I did next was to crash it (using 0xdeadbeaf as the third parameter for the fcntl call) in order to be able to take another look at iso_font. Here is what I saw: Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap. 0x002bdd44 in ttioctl (tp=0x2292a04, cmd=1074295912, data=0xdeadbeaf <Address 0xdeadbeaf out of bounds>, flag=0, p=0x21b7b18) at /SourceCache/xnu/xnu-1228.12.14/bsd/kern/tty.c:964 warning: Source file is more recent than executable. 964 *(struct winsize *)data = tp->t_winsize; (gdb) x/4hx iso_font 0x433268 <iso_font>: 0x0018 0x0050 0x01e4 0x013c (gdb) print tp->t_winsize $2 = { ws_row = 24, ws_col = 80, ws_xpixel = 484, ws_ypixel = 316 } So the iso_font was indeed changed in the expected way. :-) To make this disclosure full: I discovered the kernel panic in August 2008. I wrote to Apple but the only reply I got was indicating that they are investigating the problem. In July 2009 I finally spent some time and debug the problem. After I found that it could be used to write arbitrary data in memory I wrote again to Apple. This time they wrote back asking me if I want to be credited in the Security Update. They kept their promise. :-) Jul 12, 2009 / 11:25pm About 3 weeks ago, working on smallworld . Things looked a little different then.
